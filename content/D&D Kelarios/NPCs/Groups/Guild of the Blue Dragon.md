You walk into his territory, he owns you. He's your friend.  He hoards the diamonds for resurrections. You work for him, and he will hook you up with all the magic items, but you work for him. You wear blue, you fly his banner. You can still worship your gods. You wear dragon teeth and spread the word of this blue dragon. But if you don't, he will mess you up and make an example of one of you. If you cross him, he kills one of you. He doesn't kill the one that crosses him, he kills one of the others. The one of you that betrays me, I won't kill you, I'll kill one of the others. He will gear you up and you give you all the magic items, but you work for him.
The magic items will know if you betray him.
