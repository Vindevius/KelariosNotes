### The Siege of Marcaith

- Lvl: 16

After the events in the demiplane, the party, now in the Shadow Keep, slept. Diana had prisoners draw the final 13 cards from the Deck of Many Things. An avatar of death killed one, a devil took another, and Reggie shot one. Another was granted the use of the wish spell, using it to teleport away. Another prisoner's soul was taken and trapped somewhere in the multiverse and another had the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind appear in his hands. The final card Diana drew herself, which leveled her up.

Orion gave Poppy, who is a little girl, a broken sword. The other Shadow members for not too happy about that one, particularly Helah Scar.

After the final war preparations were made, the Shadows teleported the army close to Marcaith's Fortress. Diana, with the help of Charadraak Quipclaw, befriended the adult white dragon near Staderia, offering the conquered fortress as its new lair. The white dragon agreed and accompanied them to the Thilcaith Plateau. The army camped outside the fortress, where the ancient black dragon Qimrirth was perched. As night fell, the party made came inside Diana's instant fortress. The night passed without either side attacking.

In the morning, the siege began with the three dragons attacking in the sky and the army unleashing trebuchets and balistas toward the fortress. Marcaith's forces attacked and each side launched fireballs and very magics at each other. The party polymorphed into various beasts and made their way into the fortress.

After a few short battles, the party freed Aladus and Gurgi from their cells, along with Philip the archmage who Diana had spy for her. Philip was missing his right leg and had a nasty scar across his face. Gurgi was very quiet and had very little energy. Aladus, on the other hand, when cured of feeblemind, sprung into action desiring vengeance. The party fought through the rest of the fortress, eventually encountering Zayn Shadowend, the new cult leader and previous kidnapper of Diana when she was a child. After a battle with him around the sealed and cracked portal surrounding Marcaith's prison, they killed him.

Marcaith threatened them through the portal, which was cracked just enough for him to shoot a blast of acid at Leysa when she sassed him. This brought Leysa close to death. Diana, Leysa, and Aladus sealed the portal holding Marcaith, fixing the cracks.

Another shadowy figure appeared silhouetted on the other side of the portal. It was a tall and slim figure, with two large horns on its head and a set of large wings. The entity held a staff that it hit the portal with, sending massive cracks throughout it. The party left after setting up a trap above the portal.

Diana and Leysa asked their deities about the entity. Exsoria didn't know what it was, while all Aeontas said was that it is something much worse than the Vile Ones that they shouldn't be concerned about at the moment.

The party made their way back to the Shadow Keep with their recovered friends. Gurgi was sent to Thornhall, where Neomi, Diana's mother, kept watch over him. Comrad also spent the night by his side. Diana had a late night shopping spree.
