### Periatis

Lvl: 7

Diana’s nightmare took the shape of her first kill, where she failed to save Alfablot Ginger, a member of the Shiye Tribe. The nightmare forced her to watch the torturer behead Alfablot all over again.

Leysa saw MacGyver repairing the raven's slumber that Venkalth broke to free Tariq. Derek gave it to him in order to have the ability to use it to free Exandria. Meanwhile, Leysa directed Derek through Zanryn to torture Tariq for information and then kill him, leaving his body in the ocean. Derek didn’t get any information regarding Diana and Exandria’s exact location, but he did feed Tariq to a shark.

Amaranth took the dagger out of Diana. He showed her Exandria, gagged and chained in the cell across from her. Amaranth told Diana that later that night, he would bring Diana to see the cult torture and kill Exandria on an altar further into the complex. Diana made snide comments toward Amaranth, which he responded to by stabbing her with the Dagger of Marcaith. Her next vision brought her to the raised altar where Exandria was tied, with Amaranth and a few Cult of Marcaith’s leadership members gathered. Diana couldn’t stop them as the gigantic form of Marcaith appeared from the darkness behind the raised platform. The vision faded and continued to another nightmare.

As the Santamaria docked next to the Avenger, Derek, Delilah, Poe, Lydia, Charadraak, and Lucky waited for them. Derek acquired the fixed Raven’s Slumber from MacGyver. Leysa led Osian, Derek, Gurgi, Zanryn, Delilah, Poe, Luna, Lydia (Aladus), Charadraak, and Lucky with their respective animal companions (Leysa’s dire wolf Thor, Delilah’s owl Athena, and Osian’s hawk Horus) into Periatis, where she found a mastiff and cast speak with animals. The mastiff was able to track down where Diana is using Cloaky, a rock outcropping just outside the East Docks on the eastern coast.

Zanryn discovered the main entrance through an illusory wall and a side entrance along the cliff facing the ocean. The group divided into two groups. Leysa, Osian, Derek, Gurgi, Zanryn, and Lydia snuck into the side entrance as the rest of the group barged through the main entrance. They met in the entry hall, which both passages led to, and quickly dispatched the few guards and two black guard drakes guarding the entrance. A group led by Gurgi, who cast a locate object spell on Diana’s wolf amulet, went further into the maze of tunnels to find and free Diana. This group included Gurgi, Derek, Zanryn, Luna, Lucky, and Lydia.

The other group, led by Leysa’s locate creature spell, made their way deeper into the catacombs where Exandria was located. This group included Leysa, Osian, Delilah, Poe, and Charadraak.

Gurgi and Derek’s group encountered a few cultists, including a couple of acolytes and a cult fanatic. Derek threw a crate of flammable alcohol at them, which killed the cultists still standing. Gurgi found Diana’s cell, which Derek unlocked. Diana laid manacled to the wall with the Dagger of Marcaith in her chest. Derek quickly pulled out the dagger.

### Verithinus

Lvl: 7

In this moment, Diana found the agony of the dagger fading away as time stood still. Diana found herself floating in space. She saw stars around her. As she looked around, she instinctively recognized the world of Kelarios and its moon Selara. It looked so tiny and it is the most beautiful thing Diana has ever seen. From her point of view, it looks like a ball of force is around it, separating it from the rest of the universe. As she was taking in the beauty of the stars around her, she heard a calm and serene voice say, “Aren’t you the stubborn one, Diana?”

As she turned, Diana saw a man who looked ancient, with a long gray beard, a full head of hair, and a straw hat on top of his head. He smiled at her. As soon as she looked at him, this sense of peace washed through her, and she was completely put at ease. In that instant, all the trauma and terrible visions she just witnessed fade to the back of her mind. It seemed so miniscule.

The old man introduced himself as Verithinus, the god of Kelarios. Calmly he told Diana, “Forget those images that Marcaith put you through. They are all lies, and you know it. There was no truth there. Your father, though a flawed man, loved you. You did what you could. I know you won’t fully believe me, so he’s here.”

Diana saw her father, Vaserius before her. He was semi-transparent. He approached Diana, looked down at her, and hugged her. He looked into her eyes and said, “My dearest Diana, it’s going to be okay. You do not need to take your pain and throw it at the world. You are better than me. Stronger than me. And you can do so much more than I ever could.”

Every question Diana asked, Vaserius reassured her. For the past five years, he wandered the Ethereal Plane as a ghost, watching her, hanging on to the last thing he told Diana: to be better than him. Diana asked her father how he knew who to love. He simply told her that he felt comfortable with Diana’s mother and that she stayed around and gave him peace. Vaserius understood she was talking about Derek and told Diana that she was ready. He also told her to tell Derek that he had Vaserius’ blessing to one day marry his daughter.

Finally, after a long and deep conversation with Diana, Vaserius turned to the old god and said, “I’m ready.”

Verithinus reached out his hand and said, “Peace awaits you. Go and rest.”

Vaserius said one last goodbye to Diana, telling her he would see her again one day, and faded away. He went beyond the barrier to the place of true rest. Past the outer planes and beyond the universe, anyone on Kelarios knows. Diana will not see him again until she follows him there in death.

Verithinus motioned Diana toward Kelarios and said, “There’s something I must show you. Long ago, I had to encase Kelarios in this bubble universe because of the Viles Ones. I could not let them escape from here, just as you don’t want them to escape from their current prisons. I know you wonder why I don’t do anything to stop them. I have restricted myself. I have limited my own powers to allow others to flourish. I will not interfere with free will even though they are my children. Yes, my children. All fourteen of them. And my grandchildren, the seven that they had. And the others they have. Yes, there are more than twenty-one, although they have not come into their roles yet.

“Marcaith, Domexius, Morthadius, they have fallen far. I had to sever Kelarios’ link to the rest of the universe. It is only a matter of time before my children escape their prisons. They have been gathering their strength for millennia.”

He stopped and stared into Diana’s eyes. She saw sadness enter into them as he said, “I need you to kill them. I can’t do it myself. I won’t. I won’t kill my children. Please. There’s a way to do it, and I need you and those with you to do it. They’ve hurt too many people.”

Diana agreed, and Verithinus said. “Good.”

Verithinus said, “There is going to be a choice you will make in the coming hours. I know which choice you are going to make. Just know that the choice you will make, things will work out. Though there will be a lot of pain and suffering that is going to come.”

He leaned down and placed his hand on Diana’s shoulder. She felt this overwhelming sense of power emanating from him but, with it, a sense of peace. “Whatever happens, follow your heart, follow your instinct, and don’t look back. The pain of the past will haunt you no more. Do not let it haunt you anymore. Be free of it. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be worth it. The coming months will be some of the most difficult for you, and you are going to question a lot of things. And you are going to be scared, and you are not going to know what to do at all times. But I have seen the end. Be strong, and you will help bring in a new dawn. I will be watching always.”

“Now, your friends are waiting for you.”

Diana interrupted him and asked how he could contact her again. Verithinus told her that he would always be able to contact her if he needed to and that he trusted her to accomplish the task he had for her. Verithinus then told her again that her friends and Derek were waiting for her. There was an emphasis on Derek waiting for her.

And then the old man, the stars, and the planet began to fade from Diana’s view. One word rang clear in Diana’s head: a name. The old god’s name. Verithinus. She instinctively knew that that name meant the “True One.”

As the vision faded with that one name on Diana’s mind, there was peace in her heart, even amidst the past few days, which seemed like years due to the Dagger of Marciath. Diana opened her eyes and saw Derek, the Dagger of Marcaith in his hands, the blue stone on the end glowing, and Derek looking down into her eyes. As soon as she opened her eyes, he wrapped his arms around Diana and held her tight. “Diana, you scared me so much, but we’ve got you now. I have you now. You’re safe. Exandria’s nearby. We’re going to go get her. Oh! Let me free you.” And he quickly released her bindings as he had Gurgi feed Diana munchings and crunchings.

Derek stopped and looked at Diana, and they locked eyes. He placed his hand against her cheek and placed his forehead against Diana’s. “You’ve got to stop scaring me like that, Diana.” He then kissed Diana, and she didn’t stop him.

### Exandria

Lvl: 7

Meanwhile, Leysa’s group was exploring further into the cultist complex, Osian assassinating any cultist in their way. A cultist acolyte found them and a dead cultist as they arrived at the staircase deeper into the cultist caverns. They killed the acolyte and then headed down the stairs. Leysa spotted an assassin’s foot, which she sicked Thor onto. After a brief battle, their numbers outweighed the assassin’s skill.

Diana and those with her freed the other captives in the cells back at the cellblock. The freed captives included a centaur, a half-elf monk, a half-elf ranger, a human ranger, a half-orc blood hunter, and a halfling bard. The freed captives looted the nearby armory and set off to cause mayhem within the complex. Diana and her group then rushed toward the trap in the dungeon. Diana used her wolf amulet to turn into her wolf form. Her father didn’t appear this time.

Leysa and her group, with the help of an invisible Luna, dispatched of the next room of cultists. After this, Diana and her group caught up with them. Diana hatched a plan, drawing a spectacular rendition of the altar room from her nightmare. Diana, still in her wolf form, called six wolves to her and used her bag of tricks to bring out two dire wolves and a giant badger. Lydia, who Leysa realized was actually Aladus at this point, made a severed cultist head look like Leysa’s head. Aladus also realized that Poe was his son after Poe used a middle finger spell, Aladus’ signature spell.

Diana strolled into the room, sicking four of her wolves on the two black guard drakes at the entrance. The rest of her animals followed after her, except the giant badger. Thor, Leysa’s dire wolf, also followed Diana. Diana held the fake Leysa’s head, which she rolled in front of the cult executioner, Neclord, who stood in front of a group of cultists and cult acolytes in a room with four pillars leading to the cavern’s altar.

As Neclord recognized the head as Leysa’s, he became very angry. It seemed as though Leysa, being dead, messed with the cultists’ plans. He went to attack Diana but was swarmed and knocked prone by the three dire wolves, knocking his executioner’s axe out of his hands. Diana yanked up the executioner’s axe and decapitated Neclord, picking up both his and Leysa’s fake head. A few of the cultists backed away.

The rest of the party attacked the two guard drakes at the entrance, out of sight of the cultists, as Diana and her wolves attacked the cultists. One of the guard drakes killed one of the wolves.

At the end of the cavern, on a raised platform with rough stone steps leading up to it, Amaranth stood next to a stone altar. Next to Amaranth was Zayn, the cult hand. Ameria, the cultist herald, was on the other side. Two cult fanatics were on the steps to the altar with a thug and bandit hiding nearby. Tied to the altar was Exandria, who saw Diana and struggled against her bindings, breaking one of the straps holding her down.

Amaranth waited patiently as multiple cultists fell and then cast a prismatic spray at Diana and her wolves, banishing one and killing two. Diana’s giant badger tried to burrow its way toward the altar, with Gurgi and Lucky following it.

The rest of the party entered as the cultists and the guard drakes fell. Leysa turned into a phoenix using her phoenix ring and flew to attack Amaranth, burning him. She also released Exandria’s last strap holding her down. In response, Amaranth grabbed Exandria, pulling her through Leysa’s phoenix fire, burning himself and Exandria. Zayn opened a dark violet portal, and Amaranth threw Exandria through it. The portal closed, and Amaranth told Leysa and then Diana to change out of their forms if they wanted to see Exandria again. They did so, with Osian nocking an arrow behind a pillar. Derek stood next to Diana, and Gurgi reappeared from the giant badger’s hole.

“Leave us,” Amaranth said as Zayn opened a portal that every cultist except Zayn and Amaranth left through. The cult acolytes whom the dire wolves occupied were killed by the dire wolves at this moment. Amaranth slowly stepped down the stairs as Zayn opened three dark violet portals. Amaranth said, “I’ll give you a choice. Behind one of these three portals is Exandria. You have about ten seconds before they close.”

Amaranth then backed through the middle portal and vanished. In that instant, Diana made a snap decision and rushed through the middle portal, praying to Exsoria that Exsoria would block Leysa or Derek from following her. Diana didn’t hear a response at that moment. Leysa hesitated for a few seconds before following Diana through, immediately followed by Derek.

The three portals closed as Derek ran through, leaving the rest of the party alone with Zayn. Another portal opened with a cultist acolyte coming through, dragging Exandria. Zanryn killed the acolyte immediately with a well-placed arrow. Zayn disappeared through a portal, leaving Exandria alone with the group.

Exandria looked up at the group as Delilah approached her. Exandria chucked a knife, which zipped past Delilah’s head. Luna took a shot at Exandria with her pepperbox from her place of invisibility, which missed. Delilah put her hand behind her and told the group to let her handle it. She begged Exandria to stop, but Exandria pulled out another dagger. Aladus stepped forward and cast a wish, using the equivalent of a greater restoration spell to cure Exandria.

Exandria fell into Delilah’s arms and asked for forgiveness. Delilah held her close. For a while, the group stood there. No portal opened. Osian and Gurgi were in shock after losing Leysa through the portal, but Osian did embrace Exandria, his adopted daughter. Luna was also in shock, as with both Diana and Derek gone, the leadership of the Shadows fell to her. Zanryn tried to send a message to Diana, but no message came back. Zanryn took charge and led the group out, telling everyone that Diana, Leysa, and Derek could take care of themselves and that the best thing they could do was to get Exandria to safety.

Before they left, Charadraak cast wish to bring all three of them back, but it didn’t work. However, he did find out where the portal led, which made him visibly concerned. He told the group that he would tell them what he found out when they were back in the safety of the ships. The group safely made it out of the Cult of Marcaith’s cavern complex and back into Periatis and to the ships.

Diana stepped out of the portal to a black-violet sky, dimly lighting the hilltop before her. Behind her were three dark violet portals. Leysa and Derek appeared behind her, and then each portal blinked out of existence.

The hill, which is made of a black stone with tufts of violet and red grass, stops abruptly at a cliff about fifteen feet away. Below the cliff is a valley of violet and red grass and clovers with a river snaking through it. On the other side of the river is a forest of black trees with violet and red leaves. Three spiked hills pierce the Blackwood. The land stops abruptly past the Blackwood, falling into nothing. Two desert islands float in the void to the northwest of the Blackwood. To the northeast is a frozen waste of ice with a frozen river and lake. A range of black stone mountains pierces the starless sky from the southwest to the northeast into the frozen waste. The river in front of them flows south into a lake and then off the floating island. To the southwest, a volcanic island with lava flowing from an active volcano into a lake of lava almost forms a peninsula to the main island.

Amaranth Crane is looking over the cliff at the valley below with his hands behind his back. He slowly turned to Diana, Leysa, and Derek and welcomed them to the Violet Realm. And then he jumped off the cliff.

The three of them were left confused, trying to figure out where they were. They glanced over the cliff to where Amaranth Crane’s body lay motionless 30 feet below. Diana remembered the other champions' disappearance and shouted an insult to see if Sir Daidelous would hear, using minor illusion to amplify her voice. A roar of some massive creature echoed in response to the south over the Blackstone Mountains.

Leysa thought back to rumors of a creature that was supposed to slumber beneath the Thilcaith Plateau that would match the roar. There is only one creature that would match the roar. The Tarrasque. Leysa instinctively knew that the Tarrasque was a creature that should be avoided.

Derek pointed out a group of half-dragons near the river, and the three of them began their way down the hill to Amaranth’s body.
