### The Grand Abyss

- Lvl: 14

As they enter the catacombs, the main party is cut off from those they bring with them. Only Diana, Leysa, and Orion are allowed past. Eradas only lets those he deems worthy to go through the trials in.

They continue in to face the trials Eradas has for them underneath the Cloudkey Grove in Kelar. The party encounters three riddles in three different rooms. The first riddle was: "A cluster of spikes I send to any who call me foe. In the air I stay, for those that draw my woe."

The party guessed wrong and a manticore attacked them.

The second riddle was: "My appetite knows no bounds, as I feast upon flesh. Beware my renewal, as I regrow afresh. There are but two ways to destroy my flesh."

The party guessed wrong and a dire troll appeared out of putrid water. Diana threw flammable alcohol at it, getting Orion in the crossfire. He went down and quickly exclaimed for Diana to let Neomi (Diana's mother) know he loves her. He does not answer any questions about it after Diana and Leysa bring him back from unconciousness.

The third riddle was: "Alone I stay ever watchful, as I look for enemy designs. I collect my trophies near me, they are your warning signs." This room had multiple stone statues of adventures inside it.

The party guessed wrong and a beholder appeared to attack them. The beholder nearly disintegrated Orion during the encounter. It's disintegration ray seemed fixated on Orion during the entire encounter.

After the third riddle the party walked into one final, massive room. A large pool of water was in the center. Two windows were on each side of the room, and an unlit brazier was at the other end. On the other side of it was Eradas, the only living androsphinx, who waved his paw toward a table, where a Heroes' Feast appeared. He told them one word, "Eat."

After they ate the feast, he gave them one last puzzle to solve. He asked them, "What is your strength?" and then he roared. The pool of water swirled into whirlpool, one of the windows blew a wild wind, and the other was filled with sand. The brazier blazed alive. After facing each of the elements, the party put together the word, "Together" and Eradas extinguished the elements.

Eradas brought them to the Void Forge in the demiplane known as the Void, which was mostly emptiness with the occasional island floating in the void. At the forge, Eradas instructed them in the creation of three soul spikes for Morthadius. Soul spikes are capable of shredding a gods soul into three unrepairable parts, effectively killing the god. Only Verithinus and Eradas know the method of crafting these spikes. Any who are told the knowledge will lose the knowledge when leaving Eradas' presence.

Each soul spike is created using 1000 platinum pieces and one divine essence. The soul spike, when finished, is 3 feet long and 2.5 inches at its widest and looks like a twisted javelin with divine runes along it. Eradus blessed Diana with the knowledge of creating the spiral soul spike by superheating the platinum, mixing in the material, and then using her strength to craft the spike. Eradus blessed Leysa with the knowledge to use her intelligence to place the divine runes on the soul spike that will rip the soul from the deity's body.

After the three soul spikes for Morthadius were created successfully, Eradas brought them back to his lair, where they lost the knowledge of how to craft the soul spikes. Eradas gave them the knowledge of where to find the remaining essences of Marcaith and Domexius, as well as two tuning forks, one to the Abyss and another to Carceri. The three of them left his lair, and joined their friends back in the Cloudkey Grove.
