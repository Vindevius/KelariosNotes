### Into Carceri

- Lvl: 17

The party ventured into Carceri, where they went through a hedge/stone maze. They were separated, encountered a unique group of doppelgangers, and were eventually reunited. They found the deep gnome Scarbest's lab, where Diana bribed him with very high quality alcohol. Scarbest disabled the two cannons triggered to fire at the door and opened the door. Scarbest gave them the Domexium metal they needed. His steel defender, Jerry, appeared out of the cluttered room. Orion put a sombrero on Jerry.

The party convinced Scarbest, who was very interested in explosives, even giving some bombs to the party, to leave Carceri with them. Scarbest loaded all of his belongings into his massive bag of holding, including the cannons. Scarbest led them out of the maze and toward a nearby mountain where a corrupted empyrean guarded one of the few portals out of Carceri.

The party battled the empyrean, his two goliath soldiers, a giant eagle, a lion, and lioness. Comrad got the last blow against the mighty empyrean and the party left through the portal, which led to the Abyss. Leysa then plane shifted the party back to the material plane, where they visited Eradas one last time to craft the soul spikes for Domexius.
