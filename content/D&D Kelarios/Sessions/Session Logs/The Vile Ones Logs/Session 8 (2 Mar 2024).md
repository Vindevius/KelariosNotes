### Phoenix Flight

Lvl: 9

Diana and Leysa separately made their way back to the cave. Along the way, Diana crept invisibly to where the Chimera roaming the Violet Plains had killed and ate part of the wyvern the two of them had killed on their first day in the Violet Realm. Diana extracted 5 vials of wyvern poison from it as Leysa attempted to catch up to her.

Back in the cave, Derek had the Dagger of Marcaith embedded in Amaranth when they arrived. They brought Amaranth's unconscious body over the mountain to where the Tarrasque was roaming. Diana tied Amaranth to a boulder with a bell that would ring if he struggled, and then she took the Dagger of Marcaith out of him. It did not take long for the Tarrasque to notice him and then eat him. That was the last they saw of Amaranth.

A message from outside the Violet Realm broke in from Delilah telling Diana it was now Exandria's birthday. Using Diana's Shadow Tattoo, Leysa was able to send a message that broke through, which Aeontas intercepted to send directly to Exandria.

Leysa enacted their plan to travel the large void to the swamp island. Derek drank a poison and crawled into the bag of holding for the journey. Diana willingly went into the extra raven's slumber as Leysa took on her phoenix form. Leysa's phoenix form was able to hold as another day passed and they made it to the swampland.

As Leysa let Diana out, they saw a will-o-wisp beckoning them from the swamp, but they knew better than to follow it. They traveled through the swamp, eventually encountering a group of lizardfolk and their shaman Vishk. It was at this time that Derek popped out of the bag of holding. Diana convinced them that they were sent by their goddess Semuanya using magic.

The lizardfolk led them to their small village raised above the swamp where they were presented before King Kask. After a brief discussion, King Kask decided to accompany them to slay Gorganth, the black dragon nearby. Shaman Vishk as well as four other lizardfolk accompanied them. One of the lizardfolk, Yushrit, led the way.

### Gorganth's Lair

The party traveled to a fog covered portion of the swamp and into a dark and foggy cave system. Inside, they encounter umbraki, which they were able to destroy. The whole time, the lizardfolk did not engage in these battles.

In the final room before Gorganth, the trio had a difficult time defeating a black iron golem, two black iron animated armors, a swarm of umbraki that merged together, and a hidden roper. Eventually, they were able to win the day.

Before entering Gorganth's lair, the party took a short rest to recuperate. The lizardfolk stepped into the lair, which had two stagnate pools of water on either side of a large cavernous room. The central portion was held up by two pillars on either side. It led to a small altar. Behind the altar was a serious of steps leading up to a large foundation stone made of blackstone. Diana followed behind the lizardfolk invisibly.

Upon entering the lair, Gorganth flew from behind the foundation stone and landed in front of the altar. Shaman Vishk bowed to Gorganth and betrayed the party. Gorganth flew around his lair, attacking the party from afar. Gorganth cast darkness at the entrance of his lair, which only Diana could see through. This caused Leysa and Derek to focus on the lizardfolk, while Diana attacked Gorganth with her dragon slayer executioner's axe. At one point, Gorganth slipped under the water and vanished from sight. When he reemerged, he shot a line of acid at each of the party members. Leysa fell unconscious momentarily because of this.

Derek quickly gave her a potion, and Leysa rejoined the fight. Although she was now frightened of Gorganth. Shortly afterward, Leysa smacked King Kask with her battlepan of Aeontas, which, in a burst of radiant energy, disintegrated King Kask's head, killing him. Diana took out the Shaman as the remaining lizardfolk attempted to escape.

Morganth bit down on Diana, causing her to go unconscious until Derek shoved a potion down her throat while she was still in Morganth's mouth. After a series of three critical hits with her executioner's axe, Diana cleaved Morganth's head off as he attempted to fly away from her.

Diana was able to take 11 vials of dragon blood, 17 pounds of dragon scales, 15 dragon claws, and one of Morganth's horns from Morganth's corpse.

Diana and Leysa approached the foundation stone, and plunged Exsoria's dagger into it. This caused the entire demiplane to quake as cracks of violet energy appeared around them. After a second attack, the cracks widened and Derek almost fell into the cracks. Diana was able to safely bring Derek into the extra raven's slumber, which was now around her neck.

With one last plunge of Exsoria's dagger, the entire demiplane exploded, sending both Diana and Leysa into the cracks. Diana focused on the Shadow Keep as Leysa focused on Castle Staderia. The two of them tried to hold onto to each other, but their grips loosened as they were pulled in two different directions.

In the material plane, Osian, Gurgi, among others were gathered on a balcony at Castle Staderia as an earthquake shook the world. The Samula Hills to the east of Staderia were now 50 miles away instead of just 5 miles. And it began to snow. Leysa appeared next to them as the area around Staderia was coated in ice and snow. An adult white dragon could be seen flying near the Samula Hills.

Leysa was able to figure out that the snow was caused by Diana and her breaking the foundation stone, causing the different parts of the Violet Realm to leak into the material plane. The Frozen Wastes had encompassed Staderia and the surrounding area. Leysa was also able to surmise that the increased size of Kelarios was not caused by them, but by Verithinus, the god Diana had encountered prior to their time in the Violet Realm.

Osian, as well as Gurgi, who clinged to Leysa, and Exandria, welcomed Leysa back and asked where Diana was. Leysa scryed and was able to find that Diana was almost a thousand miles to the northeast past Mount Morthus in an Icy Tundra north of the Barren Lands of Exaria.

Diana released Derek from the raven's slumber and the two of them tried to figure out where they were. Diana was able to figure out through Luna that much of the continent of Krelari had been effected by the destruction of the Violet Plains. Staderia was covered in ice, the Western City States was a swamp, the southern portion of the Thilcaith Plateau (Wuryn) and parts of Archaios and the Western City States had become volcanic, and other places had similar catastrophes happen to them.

The party ended split in different parts of a very different world.
