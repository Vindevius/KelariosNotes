### The Ambush

- Lvl: 12
Garic only wants to talk. He mentions his spy in the Shadows keeping him up to date. He demands they hand over the Morthadium. He stuns whoever attacks him first and shadow steps away. Before he leaves, he mentions how his spy will be fine using the word "she" or "her" to describe her. His spy is Valencia Kalon. She is a member of the Council of Shadows and a Monk (way of mercy). Garic saying "she" is an attempt to take some pressure off of Diana's suspicions concerning Draynnon.
- Valencia Kalon is just inside the Shadow Keep when the party enters. She asks who was outside and attempts against their passive Insight to deceive them as she exclaims how close he got to the orphans she is over.
- Aladus will immediately cast disintegrate at 8th level at Garic using one of his two powdered nycaloth brain. This brings the save DC up to 24. Garic needs to roll a 20 in order to avoid it. Garic does have advantage on spell saves. I already rolled for this encounter. Garic rolled a Nat 1 and a Nat 2. I will be using the Nat 1 for this instance. The DM gains a hope on an enemy Nat 1 and loses a fear.
- A group of 6 gnolls & 3 hyenas covers Garic's escape. Stealth Checks (pass without trace): gnoll 1: 29, gnoll 2: 22, gnoll pack leader: 26, gnoll shaman: 36, gnoll hunter: 22, gnoll flesh gnawer: 30, hyena 1: 21, hyena 2: 18, hyena 3: 31
	- The party will only see 2 hyenas (1&2) and Garic. The Gnoll Shaman is wild shaped as a giant goat.
	- Kyrus has been tracking the gnolls and arrives shortly after the gnolls attack after a hope is spent.
	- Reggie, Luna, and a shadow assassin have a chance of firing from the windows if a hope is spent. Reggie has a chance of throwing a NaK Vial for the first time.
- Draynnon whispers "nightlock" when entering the Shadow Keep. He needs to beat a sleight of hand check against the others' passive perception. If he rolls an 8 or lower, Diana will notice. Otherwise, she doesn't. Diana can use a hope to roll a perception check, two hopes to add a d6 to the roll.
- Next time Gurgi gives Munchings and Crunchings to Leysa, he can do a medicine check to find out that Leysa is pregnant with a DC 10, and a DC 20 to find out Leysa is pregnant with twins.
- Aladus regenerates Derek's eye.
