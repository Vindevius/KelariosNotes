### The Violet Realm

Lvl: 9

Diana, Leysa, and Derek took the flying carpet down to Amaranth's body, but his body moved. Amaranth peaked out from under an overhang and cast time stop. He blasted them with eldritch blast and threw the Dagger of Marcaith into Derek. One of his eldritch blasts pulled Diana off the flying carpet, even though she was invisible. A wyvern came out from the overhang, Amaranth on its back.

As Amaranth flew past Diana, she used her dragon slayer axe (executioner’s axe) to wound the wyvern as it passed. Derek and Leysa struggled to pull the Dagger of Marcaith out of Derek. As they were, Amaranth glanced down at where Diana stood invisible, smirked, then looked at Derek as he said Nelithik (the Draconic Power Word: Kill). Derek went stiff and then fell dead on the carpet. The Dagger of Marcaith slid out of him, which Leysa caught. The gate stone began to glow blue, as did its partner on Amaranth’s belt.

Amaranth simultaneously shot an eldritch blast toward Diana as he cast Power Word: Kill. It hit. Diana shot an eldritch blast at Amaranth, which missed but grounded the wyvern on the cliff above. Leysa attacked the wyvern as Diana invisibly scaled the cliff face. The wyvern did not last long as its dead body careened over the cliff.

Leysa shoved Derek’s dead body into the bag of holding as they chased after Amaranth. Diana threw a bead of force to try and capture Amaranth. It instead captured a vicious white rabbit with red eyes, which Diana rolled toward the nearby river. It was guarding a cave, which contained an altar identical to the one in Periatis. 12 suits of armor were arrayed alongside the walls.

Amaranth stood at the altar, beckoned them forward, then exited through a rusted iron door. A Jabberwock emerged from a pit on the other side of the altar, which Diana vortex warped toward the nearby river. Leysa attempted to control water and drown it as Diana walked into the cave toward the rusted door. The armor animated and attempted to kill her as the Jabberwock escaped Leysa’s drowning attempt and tried to attack her with its useless fire gaze at someone immune to fire.

Leysa kept her distance from the Jabberwock, which ignored her and went after Diana at the door. Leysa followed it in. The Jabberwock’s confusing garble prevented Diana from reacting as the Jabberwock attacked her, followed by the three remaining animated armors. The first anime armor struck her down in a critical hit. The second critically slammed her, and the final one took her last breath as Diana died. Leysa, in a rage, decapitated the Jabberwock with her battle pan, but the three remaining animated armors managed to take her down. Leysa’s Phoenix ring caused her to explode in flames, disintegrating the armor sets.

After twelve seconds, Leysa’s body reformed and she cast revivify on Diana, bursting past the resurrection barrier that exists in the Violet Plane, and bringing Diana back.

Diana went alone into the next room after a short rest. The door slammed shut behind her. The room had thirteen torches above a similar handleless rusty iron door, which began to flicker off one by one. The room was lined with small holes about a foot apart each in the 15 by 15 foot room, which was 10 feet tall. A pressure plate was in the middle of the room next to a small rusted grate.

Diana cast mirror image, created three illusions of herself to try to figure out a way forward. She placed a bag of ball bearings on the pressure plate, which relit the torches and then caused a ticking sound to begin. Diana pried off a torch, which caused the ticking to increase in speed. She placed it back. The ticking increased and a bubbling of liquid could be heard as Diana managed to break over the first door with two of her mirror images and a crowbar. A surprised Leysa was on the other side, who had attempted to open the door before.

Diana kicked the ball bearings, scattering them across the floor. After about a minute and a half, the torches went out and the way forward opened. Diana crept forward, finding a deck of cards in a leather bound case. The cards were made of ivory. Diana had her mirror image draw a card, which seemed to do nothing but vanish (it was the Ruin card). Diana tucked the cards away, not realizing it was the deck of many things.

Diana transformed into a wolf, carrying Leysa on her back as she tracked further into the cave system. Her mirror images vanished at this point. Creatures known as nothics stalked them from the shadows as they found their way into a large cavern with an underground lake.

Next to the underground lake was a large group of about fifty gremlins. One pushed another into the lake and four gremlins came out instead of one as the water bubbled.

After a short altercation involving Diana biting and killing one, Leysa convinced the gremlins to attack Amaranth with them. They quickly caught up to a semi frantic Amaranth, who could only kill the gremlins so fast as Diana, with Leysa on her back, and the gremlins descended on him. His flaw was throwing the Dagger of Marcaith at Leysa, who managed to pull it out and nail Amaranth in the chest with it. It began to dig in as Diana shoved both Exsoria’s dagger and the Dagger of Marcaith into Amaranth, which sent him into the nightmares Diana had once been subjected to. Poetic justice.

Diana gave two of his daggers to the gremlins that rushed away to make traps with them, happy as ever. A few splashes were heard as the gremlins replenished their forces. Diana dragged Amaranth’s body through nothic infested caves and out into the sunlight, just north of the hill they first arrived on. They found a cave on a mountain outcropping above them and set up camp.

Each of them were rejuvenated in that moment and Amaranth’s physical wounds healed themselves. Leysa’s Phoenix ring blazed to life as though a week had past and her previously used fiery rebirth ability had been refreshed. A muffled voice came from Leysa’s bag of holding, which a fully alive Derek crawled out of, confused as to what happened.

Diana tortured Amaranth by setting his insides on fire with flammable alcohol until he died. Diana and Leysa hunted a deer, using Leysa in her wild shape the form of a doe to distract it. They encounter three cockatrices with feed in order to avoid a fight. When they returned, after avoiding a chimera, they roasted the deer over Amaranth’s burning corpse.

Diana was able to get a message through to Luna about being alive.

  

Meanwhile, in the prime material plane, Charadraak revealed to those at the Avenger and Santamaria that Diana, Leysa, and Derek were trapped in a demiplane created by multiple wish spells. Portaling or teleporting in or out of it would be ineffective and resurrection spells and experience were hindered because of an erratic time loop.

Luna transformed into a convincing form of Diana and had everyone make a binding contract with the Outcasts’ seven tieflings to do the following: Until the return of Diana no one can write, talk, or show about Diana's disappearance and that Luna is not pretending to be Diana. They will act as if Luna is Diana.

They then boarded the Avenger and began a ten day journey to Staderia, where Charadraak was able to learn of the general layout of the Violet Realm through a wish spell. Osian, Gurgi, Exandria, Delilah, Poe, Aladus (who revealed to Poe that he was his father due to Lina’s interference), and Charadraak remained in Staderia to protect Exandria from any other kidnapping.

Luna and Zanryn headed toward the Shadow Keep to where the Shadow Council had been called.

  

In the Violet Realm, Derek remained behind with the corpse of Amaranth as Diana and Leysa searched for the unicorn of Aeontas that Leysa witnessed getting sucked into the Violet Realm. They track two sets of hooves that split off from each other. Diana’s tracks, which she tracked in her werewolf form, ended up being a black haired centaur, which pointed her toward the northeast section of the Blackwood.

Leysa’s set of hooves led her toward three hills in the center of the forest in her hawk form. She found a centaur who was cautiously glancing around it. The centaur ran off, followed by an adult green dragon, which saw Leysa and tried to eat Leysa’s hawk form as an easy snack. Leysa, however, escaped.

Diana and Leysa joined together at the unicorn, which telepathically welcomed Leysa while keeping a wary eye on Diana. Leysa attempted to use the unicorn’s connection to Aeontas to pray and contact Aeontas, but it didn’t work.

Diana attacked the unicorn, severing and escaping with its horn, which allowed a brief connection to form with Exsoria, who told her to head to a swampy landmass floating 80 miles to the east of the main island.

Diana began heading to the cave with this information while she apologized to Leysa over her earrings who followed behind her in shock.

  

In the Prime Material Plane, Luna, disguised as Diana, attended the Shadow Council saying that Derek, Leysa, and Luna were transported to a demiplane. She mentioned the need for three champions. Kagan Coal and the council brought to her attention that the Cult of Morthadius broke Mount Morthus’ top barrier. The other cults have been doing similar things. Luna, as Diana and the Shadow, sent a group of barbarians and a ranger to scout out each cult’s activities as the solstice drew closer. Diana, Leysa, and Derek had spent 28 days inside the Violet Realm, which was only three days to them.
