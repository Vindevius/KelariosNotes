### Kelar & Chaos

- Lvl: 13/14

The Aladus simulacrum transforms into their Lydia form. The party meets a broken and tired Sir Daidelous, the Champion of Numeda, who had just escaped from the Mist, the demiplane of Morthadius, which he and 6 other champions destroyed. Three of those champions died in the process (Isota, champion of Sovenia; Hezzolsia, champion of Efimera; and Yunaesa Leotuma, champion of Zorvia). The other champions (Kokorio Maish, champion of Neglamel; Sagard Destrian, champion of Ruichasm, and Caramella Farfoot, champion of Tempronus) had gone to try and seal away the Vile Ones' portals to keep them from escaping. Diana and Leysa told him of the plan to kill them given by Verithinus. Sir Daidelous left with Aladus to tell the other champions and prepare to face the Vile Ones when they escape.

In the tavern (The Weary Pirate) below, run by a man named Jacob (who has an invisible shotgun), an elderly man named Orion met the party. He recognized Diana, although Diana did not recognize him. He joined them as their cleric.

Diana, being her chaotic self, convinced a few poor souls to draw from the Deck of Many Things. One of them received a pair of magical boots, which Diana later stole. Each of them, one by one, pulled a bad card, causing one to disappear (leaving behind his things), another to become an idiot. Another man sees this, and falls for Diana's deception. He pulls a few cards. One adds +2 to his dex, another -2 to his saving throws. He also pulls the Fates card, which will enable him to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened anytime before he dies.

The party, led by Lydia (the simulacrum), made their way to the misty streets of Kelar. The mist was caused by the breaking of The Mist demiplane. They were ambushed by people wielding a magic that controlled metal and defeated them.

They met Nexus Sparrow, a warforged, the head member of Kyria's Council of the Star the governing body of Kyria. He showed them the entrance into Eradas' lair, the androsphinx that guards the Void Forge, the only place that soul spikes can be made.
