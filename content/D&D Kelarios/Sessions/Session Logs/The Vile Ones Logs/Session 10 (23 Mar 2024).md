### The Gray Wastes

- Lvl: 11

After the reveal of Garic as the Champion of Marcaith, Leysa mentioned to Osian about casting zone of truth in any future meetings. Meanwhile, in the Shadow Keep, Jerry, a blue tiefling, made a binding contract between Diana and Philip the resurrected Archmage. The contract is as follows: 

- Philp will infiltrate the cult of Marciath and retrieve the tuning forks to the Abyss. If possible he will also infiltrate the cult of Domexius and retrieve the tuning forks to Carceri. He will not say or show that he is working for the shadows and will make his resurrection appear genuine with the help of the Demon Balor who was the former Champion of Morthadius who once possessed Diana.

- Diana will not kill, harm, or betray Philp as he is also not going to cause harm, injury, or betray Diana. Diana will talk to Verithinus about making Philp the replacement for Marcaith when the time comes. Diana will also offer help to Philp in his trials to return to the cults and provide assistance as needed.

Diana tells Luna to slip people truth serum in meetings going forward. Diana searches for seer orbs, finding one in Thornhall with Neomi, her mother. Another is found in the Shadow Keep's meeting room. Luna touched the orb and became locked onto it until Diana intervened. Through Exsoria, Diana fixed the one in the meeting room to show falsehoods. Leysa found a seer orb in the Staderian Keep war room and destroys it. She also found out that her dire wolf, Thor, is affected by transmutation magic.

Diana conversed with Luna finding out that Luna saw Diana's interaction with Verithinus. Diana also mentioned Reggie creating something known as the Call of the Alpha. Reggie also started experimenting with creating magical items and tattoos out of the severed unicorn horn. Also in Reggie's workshop is Little Reggie, a 5 year old who is Yelena Belova's adopted son. Yelena is Reggie's dead sister who was killed by the cult of Marcaith. Little Reggie really likes explosions. Diana taught him to make flammable alcohol. Reggie was working on vials filled with NaK, which caused explosions.

Diana gathered Derek and Aladus to go to Staderia to get Leysa. Aladus walked in on Zanryn and Draynnon during a private moment when nobody else would. The five of them then teleported to the Staderian Keep.

Leysa had a realization that Gurgi's munchings and crunchings came partially from dead muppets. The party, now with Leysa and Gurgi, plane shifted to Oinos in the Gray Wastes. As they walked toward the Gray Tower, a tower filled with fiendish yugoloths, Diana discovered that the dire wolf Thor was a polymorphed Thor (as in the Norse deity). She kept this information to herself.

When the party reached the tower, they battle various yugoloths (mezzoloths, canoloths, dhergoloths, and two large nycaloths). Draynnon was show fighting with a necrotic blade. One of the nycaloths injured Derek, causing Diana to release her fury on it. No one hurts her man.

Aladus powdered the nycaloth's brain and Leysa followed suit. The powdered nycaloth brain makes spells more powerful. The party infiltrated the tower. Leysa killed two mezzoloths in a roll with a Nat 20, intimidating the remain ones, who let them pass. The party traversed through an Arcanaloth named Ozzalon's lab, an illusory room using Diana and a rope, and passed by a prison with a nightmare (corrupted pegaus) and a night hag. Diana became obsessed with freeing the nightmare.

In the final room, Yondal, a gray-skinned ultroloth, with Galla, an arcanaloth, ignored the party as mezzoloths and canoloths attacked them. Diana charged toward Yondal and negotiates as the others battle. Multiple wolves that Diana summoned die and Leysa transform into her phoenix form.

Yondal halts the battle and tells Diana after a Nat 20 persuasion that if she and her group survives the shadow serpent guarding the Morthadium fungus they came to get on the other side of the room, Diana can have the nightmare and kill the night hag.

The battle with the shadow serpent begins with Leysa in her phoenix form blinding it. The shadow serpent downs Derek and Thor. Diana takes Derek into the Raven's slumber. Both Diana and Derek were swallowed by the shadow serpent. Diana used the noose of the gods for the 1st time.

Drayynon accidentally sends an eldritch blast at the shadow serpent while killing a canoloth. Only Leysa noticed. The shadow serpent used its shadow breath twice, the second time on low health. As the shadow serpent prepared to bite Aladus, which would have been a critical hit to kill Aladus, Phoenix Leysa slayed the shadow serpent, which dissolved into shadow.

Diana, Derek, and the one surviving wolf (out of 6), make there way to the prison after Yondal and Galla congratulate them while finishing their popcorn. Leysa extracts the Morthadium. Diana tears apart the night hag in her werewolf form, and befriends the nightmare with a Nat 20, naming her Azura. The party left the tower and plane shifted to the Shadow Keep, where Garic, the Champion of Marcaith, waited for them.
