### Morthadius Redux

- Lvl: 17/18

The party made their way to Mount Morthus to prepare for Morthadius' escape from the Shadowfell. They were joined by Einar, Katerina, Zanryn, and Draynnon. Two days before the summer solstice, the party infiltrated the volcano, which culminated in a battle with the now red dracolich Alvodra, a bounty hunter known as the Silencer, a few cultists, and a bunch of Umbraki. Upon entering, Einar triggered four glyphs of warding, one of which was an explosion.

After a short fight, the party was able to kill Alvodra once more along with all of the cultists and Umbraki. Only the Silencer was able to escape. The party then trapped the chamber using holy water and multiple spells to weaken Morthadius when he emerged from the Shadowfell.

The summer solstice arrived. Shortly after the sun set, Morthadius broke free of the Shadowfell and made his way toward the secondary sealed barrier at the top of the volcano. Due to the party's preparation, they quickly dispatched of him with the use of the three soul spikes. However, Morthadius was able to kill Einar, whose body fell into the Shadowfell. As he died, Morthadius seemed to speak to Verithinus, his father. All that remained was Morthadius' skeleton and some shadowy essence of his power.

Out of the Shadowfell, the Raven Queen emerged, taking in the shadowy power and ascending to Morthadius' place in the pantheon. The Raven Queen brought Einar's body out of the Shadowfell with her, restoring Einar to life, as Morthadius had corrupted, in the Raven Queen's eyes, the sanctity of the moment of death. Katerina held the resurrected Einar as the Raven Queen acknowledged the party, before she descended back into the Shadowfell.

The Silencer arrived shortly after. He tried to leave when he realized Morthadius had been defeated. As he went to teleport away, Diana hit him with her dagger, interrupting his spell. Diana, with the help of a NaK cannon from Scarbest, silenced the Silencer.
