### Council for Delilah

Lvl: 6

  

Leysa, Gurgi, Thor, and Zanryn headed toward Thornhall as Diana and Derek prepared for a council meeting about Delilah. Delilah Polaris was the personal bodyguard and girlfriend of Exandria when Exandria was kidnapped. Delilah requested the Shadow to join Diana on her quest to find Exandria. Delilah arrived at the Keep of Shadows with a blindfolded Poe Hawthorn, who is not a member of the Shadows but a close friend of Exandria’s.

Delilah was brought into the council meeting, including Diana, Derek, Helah Scar (a leader in Staderia), Jasper Tinker (the resident artificer), Kagan Coal (a Goliath over assassinations), Zilyana (representing the Thorn Touched Tribe), and the Shadow (which is just a minor illusion created by Diana on a mirror).

Delilah begged to be allowed to join Diana in finding Exandria. She cited her need for redemption and her love for Exandria. After a debate, Delilah was told to leave the room. The council allowed Delilah to accompany Diana on her quest to find Exandria.

As Diana left the council, she was greeted by Poe, whom she despises, talking about going with them. Diana refuses to allow him, and he defiantly says he isn’t a Shadow member, so she can’t boss him around. He began stuttering immediately after when he remembered Diana could easily stop him.

Derek mentioned in Thieve’s Cant that if Poe comes with them, there is a high chance he doesn’t make it back alive. Diana agreed he could come with them due to this possibility. They shortly left with Zilyana and went back to Crassus.

### Prepare for Launch

Meanwhile, Leysa and those with her came across a unicorn connected to Aeontas on their way to Thornhall. It approached Leysa and allowed her to pet his snout. A violet portal appeared and sucked the unicorn through it. Leysa and Zanryn attempted to stop it, but they were not strong enough. Leysa had no idea what the portal led to.

When they arrived in Thornhall, they were greeted by Neomi, Diana and Osian’s mother. Osian was also there. Leysa reunited with her husband, who convinced her to let him come with them to find their daughter, Exandria. Osian left to find someone who could take them to Drovos and give Khetra, his father, the authority to act in his place as King. Zanryn contacted Diana about this, and Diana told Zanryn not to allow it to happen.

Luna Ravenwood, a member of the Shadows, was there to join them on their quest. Zanryn and Luna convinced Leysa to tell Osian he wasn’t joining them. She told Osian this when he returned with Elaith, who could transport them to Drovos. Osian vehemently defended his right to search for his daughter. Ultimately, Elaith opened a portal in a tree, and Osian joined them as they entered the forest outside Drovos.

Zanryn led them to the Santamaria, where a couple of goblins greeted them. They met Captain Ardella Sephiran. They also met Archie, an owl bear the pirates on the Santamaria recently adopted. The Santamaria left port to head toward Archdale on the island of Seerus.

Diana and her group found their way through Crassus to the Avenger. Lucky greeted them, commenting how they couldn’t stay away. Astaroth Crow, Diana’s previous fling, found them and persistently tried to figure out where they were heading. Diana brushed him off, and he eventually left. As he left, Diana noticed an amulet around his neck, similar in design to the raven’s slumber amulet Leysa has, which holds her elephant, Jane. It is also similar to the same type of amulet that Diana saw a resurrected Tariq get sucked into.

On the Avenger, Diana found Zale as flirtatious as ever. Lucky mentioned new, interesting crewmates that had joined them. Diana came face to face with Rose, the druid who visited Venadria’s Lair with her. Little Tully, the red dragon wyrmling, and the two kobolds, Drox and Klari, tasked with serving Tully, were also there. Charadraak and Lydia were on board, too.

The Avenger prepared to begin the journey to Periatis.
