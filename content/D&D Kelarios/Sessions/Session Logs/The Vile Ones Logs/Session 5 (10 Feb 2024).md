### Set Sail

Lvl: 6

The Santamaria and the Avenger set sail to their separate destinations. Leysa learned various stories about Diana over the first few days aboard the Santamaria. This included a story of Diana diving into the ocean for a dagger she dropped and not finding her way back for an hour. Most of the stories had to deal with Diana’s daggers and alcohol.

Meanwhile, Diana on the Avenger encountered a young dragon turtle named Korotios, which they bribed into attacking a ship following them. Astaroth Crow, as well as a resurrected Venkalth, was on that ship. Korotios destroyed one of the ship's masts before Venkalth bribed Korotios to stop. The broken mast slowed the ship, which allowed the Avenger to lose sight of it over the horizon.

On the morning of the third day, the spring equinox, Diana and Leysa had a nightmare about Exandria being tortured with the Dagger of Marcaith in her chest. Diana was able to hear the sound of the ocean outside the stone cell. A deep and dark voice whispered, “Time’s running out.” Then, the vision ended.

Diana had a deep conversation about it with Derek. Derek asked why Diana trusted him with almost everything while distrusting everyone else. She explained that he stuck around, and that was rare. Derek changed the topic to their quest to find Exandria. Diana heard word that the champions that helped seal away Morthadius went missing near Ragus. Sir Daidelous was also one of the ones who went missing.

On the fourth day, the Santamaria encountered a Kraken on their way to Archdale. The crew came together to kill it using cannons, ice storms, fireballs, Jane the elephant, and other means. They celebrated their victory with drinks.

About the same time, the Avenger encountered an unnaturally fast ship, the same ship from before fully repaired, approaching them from the north. A wall of mist loomed in front of the ship, which Captain Zale considered seeking refuge in.

Diana shot an eldritch blast at Astaroth Crow as the ship caught up to them. Lucky also shot the back two cannons, damaging the ship. Many of the cult members on the other ship boarded the Avenger. Lydia disintegrated a bandit, and Charadraak levitated another bandit. Rose sent a tidal wave between the two ships, widening the gap. During the battle, Diana turned invisible and scaled one of the ship’s riggings. Venkalth revealed his Marcaith form. Two black guard drakes joined the fray. One of the Avenger’s mages cast fireball onto the opposing ship. Lucky and his cannoneers pelted rounds of cannonballs into the enemy ship. This eventually caused the ship to break and the fire to reach the explosives with the cannons. The enemy ship exploded and sunk into the water.

Little Tully, the red dragon wrymling, joined the fight, biting the head off a cultist. Both Venkalth and Astaroth surrounded Derek, who fought for his life. Diana used a rope to swing and kick Astaroth in the face, which killed him. Venkalth used his reaction to grab the amulet on Astaroth’s neck and break it. Derek then cut the head off of Venkalth, killing him once again. Diana and Derek locked eyes at that moment. Both of them blushed for a moment. Then Tariq appeared between them out of the broken amulet.

Diana attempted to punch Tariq but accidentally punched Derek instead. Derek then punched Tariq. Out of the fog in front of the ship, a black ship with gray torn sails appeared. Tariq was thrown in the brig below deck.

A wyvern approached and circled Artemis in the crows' nest. On the top of the black ship were the leaders of the Cult of Marcaith. Amaranth Crane stood at their front. On his left was a man wielding an executioner’s axe. On his right was Zayn Shadowend, the cult hand, and second-in-command. Zayn also was part of the group that kidnapped Diana during her childhood. A large group of cultists stood behind them.

Amaranth spoke, giving Diana a choice. Come willingly with the cult, or watch as he kills everyone on the ship. He gave her a minute to decide. Derek adamantly disagreed, but Diana told him one of them needed to survive for the Shadows. Charadraak and Lydia approached, offering help. Lydia, who Diana realized was a disguised Aladus, cast the wish spell to try and keep the black ship frozen in time for one day. The wish was unsuccessful, but Aladus did not lose his ability to cast Wish.

Seeing no other choice, Diana handed Cloaky (her sentient invisibility cloak) to Derek, along with most of her belongings and a set of letters to those she cared about. Diana passed the mantle of Alpha to Derek. She willingly boarded the black ship and surrendered to Amaranth, who stabbed her with the Dagger of Marcaith. Derek yelled Diana’s name as the dagger sunk into her chest.

The dagger caused no physical damage but instead left Diana in a comatose state. In this state, she relived her father’s death at the hands of Morthadius. Derek, Leysa, Exandria, and everyone she cared about appeared next to her, asking and blaming Diana for being unable to save them. The vision ended after what seemed to be an eternity, and a new, similar vision began. These visions continued one after the other, each one building on the mental anguish from the last. Each nightmare twisted her mind into further pain and regret. It showed Diana her worst fears and all of her insecurities. Each vision seemed to take a day, while in reality, it only lasted for a minute.

Derek notified Zanryn of Diana’s kidnapping and the events preceding it. Zanryn was noticeably taken aback by this, which caused Leysa, Osian, Captain Ardella, Luna, and others to come to his side. Zanryn had broken a vial of poison that he was working with when Derek sent the message. Zanryn couldn’t form any words at first, but those present were able to coax what happened to him.

After a brief moment, Leysa learned from Aeontas that Exandria and Diana were both at Periatis. Aeontas had previously refused to tell her this information because of the possible outcomes of Leysa heading directly into the Cult of Marcaith’s trap. Due to Leysa’s stubbornness and care for Diana and Exandria, Aeontas relented. The Santamaria changed its course for Periatis. Osian sent his hawk, Horus, to collect the letters Diana left behind for those she cared about, including Leysa and Luna. Derek and then Zanryn were informed that Alvodra, the now red dracolich, was burrowing into Morthadius’ prison. The rumor is that each of the three cults of the Vile Ones (Domexius, Marcaith, and Morthadius) was attempting to free their respective deity on the summer solstice. The Avenger and the Santamaria would make it to Periatis in about one day.
