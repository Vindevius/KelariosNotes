### Gladiators and the Tyrant

- Lvl: 16

After the capture of Aladus and Gurgi, Diana willing went with her uncle Tirian to be turned into King Astrolites Harlor in Tha Ethela. The rest of the party, however, teleported to Thornhall, where Orion reunited with his daughter, Neomi, Diana's mother. Neomi scolded Orion for being out of the nursing home and Leysa for adventuring while pregnant with twins. She congratulated Derek, who eloped with Diana the previous night telling him there better be a proper ceremony after the current chaos. She inquired about Diana.

Derek led the way to the Shadow Keep, where a meeting was held for the leaders and council members to plan to retrieve Aladus and Gurgi from the cult of Marcaith. The plan includes using the Staderian army in conjunction with the Shadows. This included Luna, Leysa, Derek, and Comrad. Orion, however, was left with little Poppy, who pestered him endlessly. Orion did not mind the pestering. In the meeting, Damian Sun, champion of Morrigan, was discovered to be a traitor and captured using Leysa's forget me stick.

Diana, meanwhile, was brought before King Astrolites, who had two champions take her to an antimagic cell. After a day, the champions put a shock collar on Diana, trapping her in her werewolf form. She was brought to a coliseum, where she faced four gladiators. She was able to kill two of them and nearly kill the other two before she was brought down.

Diana awoke a day later in a different cell. She prayed to Thyrm, the god of the frost giants and friend to Exsoria, for aid. He promised to send a frost giant to aid her escape for a deal. Leysa scrys on Diana and sees her distress. After telling Derek, Derek gets Orion to teleport them to Tha Ethela to rescue Diana. They are assisted by a frost giant sent by Thrym, who storms the castle to provide a distraction.

Meanwhile, Diana is taken before Astrolites, who attempts to force Diana to kneel before him using the spell dominate person. The spell fails, and Diana stands tall before him. Astrolites heard the yells at the front of the castle and went to face the frost giant. Two of his champions started to take Diana back to her cell.

The party sneakily infiltrates Keep Tha Ethela, finding Diana, who had already freed herself after Astrolites went to face the frost giant. Astrolites found them after defeating the frost giant. A chaotic fight with Astrolites occurred, involving Diana and Comrad chasing after Astrolites, a herd of small elephants, and a wall of fire.

Comrad, in an attempt to stall Astrolites, who now held the Book of the Vile Ones, challenged Astrolites to single combat, which Astrolites accepted. Comrad struck Astrolites with his lightning breath, and Astrolites promised to tear Comrad's broken wings off Comrad's back. Astrolites, after three criticals (19, 20, &, 20), kept his word. He sent Comrad to the ground and tore Comrad's broken wings from his body, leaving Comrad on death's door. Diana arrived just after and confronted Astrolites, challenging him to single combat as well.

Meanwhile, Orion was brought on the brink of death by one of Astrolites' blackguard as Leysa sat on the back of Jane, her elephant, leading the stampede of elephants. Leysa prayed to Aeontas for assistance.

Aeontas, through Leysa's prayer, brought everyone, including Astrolites, to a demiplane. Diana attempted to, and was almost successful, in killing Astrolites. However, Astrolites plead for Domexius' help, who took Astrolites out of the party's reach. Diana destroyed the Book of the Vile Ones, absorbing part of the energy into herself.

The party left the demiplane, finding themselves at the Shadow Keep. Charadraak revealed himself to be the ancient copper dragon known as Quipclaw.
