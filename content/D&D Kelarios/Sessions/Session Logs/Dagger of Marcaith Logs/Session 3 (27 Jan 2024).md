### Venkalth

Lvl: 6

  

The battle with Venkalth began as Venkalth cast darkness over the courtyard, which was counterspelled by an unknown source. Diana and her wolves grappled with Venkalth as his posse was assassinated by Zanryn, Kaliska, and Derek one by one. Kanen and Leysa helped with their spellcasting abilities. Gurgi and Thor comforted the orphans as Leysa flung spells out the window.

As the group around Venkalth died, another wave of cultists, including Arlayna, a cult acolyte, a thug, and a bandit, arrived from a side street. Venkalth mysteriously started laughing as his avatar form faded before falling asleep for a few seconds. Venkalth stood up and briefly transformed into Marcaith's avatar form. Zanryn shot Arlayna, disabling her remaining arm. One of the wolves, Tim, was killed by Venkalth. The remaining wolf bit a cultist's left hand off.

Eventually, Diana knocked Venkalth unconscious, causing the remaining cultists to try to flee. Jewel, the remaining wolf, killed the cultist whose hand she bit off. Diana shot Arlayna in the head as she retreated, killing her. Only a cult acolyte escaped.

Two people appeared on a nearby balcony, clapping. One was a tall man in red robes with blond hair, copper eyes, and a sleek wooden staff. The other was a blonde-haired half-elf woman with a reinforced lute. They gracefully floated down to the courtyard. The man introduced himself as Charadraak and the woman as Lydia.

Charadraak proceeded to make a lot of jokes that he thought were quite funny. They revealed themselves to be friends of Aladus. When asked where he was, they joked about which one they were talking about. Aladus and his simulacrum are in different places. One is in Staderia, and the other is in Crassus. They didn’t tell the party which of the two was the real Aladus.

Diana received a message from Lucky that he and a few others were heading to meet them. Diana also received a message from Delilah Polaris, Exandria’s girlfriend. “Have you found Exandria yet? Do you need help? I can come with you. I need to find her. I failed her.”

Diana told her that there would be a council meeting concerning her in two days.

A man appeared, looking down at Arlayna’s corpse. Diana recognized him as Astaroth Crow, a previous fling of hers. Jewel took care of Arlayna’s corpse as Diana desperately tried to get rid of Astaroth. Astaroth mentioned his quest to find the werewolf from years earlier. He seemed suspicious of Diana but didn’t seem to have any real reason to suspect her. He left soon after.

Lucky, Zale, Uni, and a female tiefling mage arrived at The Legacy Theater. They were thrilled to learn that Arlayna had been killed, avenging Vaeri’s death. Jewel came back from taking care of Arlayna’s body. Diana released Jewel, who howled and returned to the woods around Crassus. The tiefling mage checked the body and shortly came back.

Lucky enjoyed vodka with Diana and Leysa, who were both starting to get drunk. Leysa drunkenly called Lucky a cute bunny, who took great offense to it. Lucky tried to throw hands with Leysa but was held back by Diana. Leysa eventually walked away, and Diana put Lucky down. He immediately walked up to Leysa, grabbed her leg, and asked if she was going to apologize. She did, but she didn’t mean it.

The pirates left with Tanna, one of the orphans and a changeling, to join them on the Avenger.

As night fell, the party made their way outside the city with two older orphans named Ivasa, a half-elf, and Maera, a tiefling. Zilyana waited for them to help send them to the Keep of Shadows in Staderia, where they would question Venkalth. They stayed the night there so Zilyana could rest and recover her spells. During the night, Diana kept watch as Venkalth awoke, gagged and tied up. Diana took an amulet of Marcaith from him and destroyed it. Marcaith’s voice woke up the entire camp and covered an area around it with acid, completely dissolving the amulet. Marcaith threatened to eat their flesh.

### Torture

Lvl: 6

  

The next day, the party arrived at the Keep of Shadows, the headquarters of the Shadows. As Leysa ate breakfast and explored the upper floors, Diana tortured Venkalth. She cut both his arms and his left leg, filling the cuts with gunpowder. She blew off his left arm and then forced him to drink a potion that slowly turned him to stone. She stopped it shortly before it covered him. Venkalth gave very little useful information to Diana. Diana received a message from Lady Laoise, “I heard some rumor around town about the cult of Marcaith. They’ve been focusing a lot of their activities toward the Sea.”

Diana had Venkalth choose between three pits and Jasper’s experiment room. He chose the middle pit. Venkalth willingly jumped into the pit. His last words were, “So you must be Squishy.”

Poppy, the youngest at the keep, tried convincing Leysa to let her join them on their adventure. Leysa made the mistake of saying maybe. Poppy snuck past the guards to find Diana in the council room, where she asked Diana to take her on a quest. Diana had her taken out of the Den of Shadows back to the above-ground keep.

The council brought the two orphans, Leysa and Gurgi, into the council room. Ivasa was assigned to be a rogue under Kaliska in Crassus. Maera was assigned to be a fighter under the leadership of Nico Milo, a centaur in Nuveda. The two orphans then left the room.

After some discussion and Leysa remembering a rumor concerning the Cult of Marcaith and the Seas, they limited Exandria’s location to somewhere near Periantis or Archdale. Periantis is on an island off the coast of the mainland. Archdale is the capital of the Island nation of Seerus, southeast of Periantis. Diana and Derek would take the Avenger to Periantis, while Leysa, Gurgi, and Zanryn would take its sister ship, the Santamaria, to Archdale.

The party rested for the night in the keep.
