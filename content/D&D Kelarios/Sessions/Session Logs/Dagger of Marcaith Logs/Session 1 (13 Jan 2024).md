### Venadria’s Lair

Lvl: 5

At a tavern in Nuveda known as The Psychotic Dwarf, run by a dwarf named Namnal Goldhorn, a dwarf named Yaldrek Oakengrip asked for help in acquiring the egg of the recently deceased dragon to the north named Venadria. Diana and Leysa, accompanied by a tiefling Blood Hunter named Kyrus, a half-elf paladin named Sir Daidelous, and a high elf druid named Rose, accepted the quest and set off to Venadria’s lair.

As they approached the lair, they saw an adult red dracolich fly northward out of the mountain. Kyrus pushed Sir Daidelous into the entrance, where he persuaded two kobolds to guide them into the undead-infested lair. Diana became invisible through the use of her invisibility cloak “Cloaky” and ventured into the kobold caverns.

The party encountered a room of zombies that Diana snuck past and Rose flew past as an owl. Sir Daidelous and Kyrus easily struck down the first two zombies with their radiant weapons and Leysa finished off the last one with her battle pan.

Diana kicked a prone zombie, which was able to latch onto her invisible foot for a brief moment. Kyrus killed the zombie as he walked by. Diana snuck through a small room of skeletons as Rose in her owl form flew past her. The rest of the party destroyed two of the skeletons, one of which took a rather embarrassingly long time. Kyrus disable the final skeleton by taking off its left arm and both legs. It was able to claw at his foot, but the party left it alone as they entered the final room.

The final room was a vast cavern where Venadria’s hoard lay. Inside, a broken red dragon egg lay on an altar. A necromancer and three cultists were subduing the ghost of Venadria. Rose struck first by reappearing in her normal form and casting tidal wave, drowning one of the cultists. Diana shot another cultist hiding behind a pillar as she walked into the cavern. Kyrus killed the final cultist and Sir Daidelous engaged the necromancer. Leysa walked in and blinded the necromancer by destroying her eyes. The necromancer instinctively cast fireball, which almost killed Rose, who turned into a spider. That was her choice. It had nothing to do with the fireball.

Diana shot the necromancer, and Kyrus gave the death blow with his two greataxes. After the necromancer died, the ghost of Venadria was released from captivity. Venadria had time to thank the party and ask them to take care of “Little Tully,” before she faded away. A red dragon wyrmling, only a few weeks old, appeared out of one of the piles of gold. Rose immediately befriended the dragon, telling “Little Tully” that she would love him forever.

Diana recognized the necromancer and cultists to be part of the Cult of Morthadius and, after finding a note in the necromancer’s pocket, realized that Alvodra the Hallowbringer, who had previously been killed as a blue dracolich, was now in the body of Venadria.

After some major consideration and maneuvering, the party managed to stuff the one-armed skeleton into the red dragon egg and seal it so that it looked as if it hadn’t been cracked.

Leysa confronted Diana about the binding contract that she found out about (and broke through Aeontas) a few weeks prior. After a long conversation about that and how Exandria (Leysa’s adopted daughter and Diana’s adopted niece) was kidnapped by the Cult of Marcaith. Kyrus eventually asked while he held the squirming egg with the skeleton inside, if the two of them were coming.

Diana received three messages from Poppy, a young girl whom she had given a shadow tattoo, asking if she could join Diana on an adventure. Diana told her to go to bed.

### The Cult Leader

The party made their way back to the tavern, where they deceived Yaldrek that the egg was genuine. Tully and the two kobolds that were escorting them remained in a cave outside of Numeda. Kyrus, Sir Daidelous, and Rose then left after receiving their payment. Diana and Leysa, however, stayed behind.

Derek, Zanryn, and Gurgi sat inside the tavern at a nearby table. Diana and Cloaky noticed a man cloaked in black and Arlayna, an assassin with whom Diana had a scuffle while adventuring with a goliath named Wramash and a druid named Xyrith. Wramash had cut off Arlayna’s right arm during that encounter. Diana turned invisible and stalked over after telling Leysa to warn Derek.

Diana stuck her dagger to Arlayna’s throat as the rest of the party snuck to one side, acting as though they were leaving. The man next to Arlayna noticed Diana’s presence and blindly cast an eldritch blast at her, which connected. Diana slit Arlayna’s throat as she was blasted back. The man briefly turned invisible before striking Diana with a pact blade, taking her hood off, and casting the spell reality break on Diana, all while he was under the influence of the time stop spell.

In one swift action, Diana dropped unconscious to the floor. The man shoved a potion of healing down her throat and said, “It’s not time for you to die yet, champion.” He then dimension-doored away with a bleeding Arlayna.

Diana recognized the rabbit’s foot at this man’s belt, and Leysa recognized him as the same cloaked figure who kidnapped Exandria. It clicked inside Diana’s head as she exclaimed to Leysa that the man was Amaranth Crane, a cult leader in the Cult of Marcaith. Diana also saw that Amaranth had the Dagger of Marcaith on his belt, which had a gate stone attached to its pommel. Another gate stone was next to it on his belt.

A few guards, one of whom was a dwarf, asked if Diana was okay. The dwarf guard bought Diana a round of drinks and a stay at the inn. After he made sure Diana was okay, Derek gave Diana a hard time about being downed by Amaranth.

Diana received a message from Xander Black, a tavern keeper in Crassus. The message was, “Come quick. Creature killing people. I only remember when I sleep. Don’t listen to its song. Hurry before it kills us all.” After further conversation through her shadow tattoo, Xander forgot about his first message to Diana and briefly remembered that Kanen Star, a tiefling bard and member of the Shadows, was missing. They then spent the night at The Psychotic Dwarf.
