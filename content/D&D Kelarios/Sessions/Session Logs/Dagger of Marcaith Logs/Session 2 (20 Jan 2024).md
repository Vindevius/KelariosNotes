### Birthday Party & Druids

Lvl: 5

Diana, Leysa, and their companions awoke at The Psychotic Dwarf. They soon journeyed south toward Crassus to investigate Xander’s cryptic message about some creature. Along the way, they ran into a troll with a red egg-shaped hat slouching beneath a tree. Next to him was a human-shaped bag and a stick. Diana was suspicious of the troll, who offered them a tray of misshapen cookies, miniature cakes, and miniature pies. Leysa tried one of the cookies, and the troll became excited. He spoke in trollish and pointed at the bag and stick.

The troll tied a rope onto the bag and tied it to a tree, which is when the party realized the bag was a pinata full of coins and gems. It was the troll’s birthday party. Leysa and Diana joined him in hitting the pinata, which broke open to reveal copper and silver coins with several common gems. The troll invited the party to stay at his large hut, which they did.

After the troll, whose name is Zee, gave the party most of the remaining tray of goodies, they headed out into the woods. Along the way, a tabaxi named Kamari Frost, a friend of Diana’s, stopped them and led them to the druidic Thorn Touch Tribe’s encampment. The party met Ulric Pine, a hermit goblin Diana had befriended. He was at the encampment for alcohol.

After a meeting with Madris, the elder druid, about the crisis at Crassus, Zilyana, Madris’s assistant, opened a portal in a tree to allow the party to get to the woods directly outside Crassus. Leysa crafted wax earplugs from the nearby woods to protect themselves from the creature’s song that Xander warned them about. The party headed into the city. Gurgi and Cloaky were both affected by the creature’s song. Gurgi was affected because his earplugs weren’t all the way in. Cloaky didn’t have ears to put earwax in.

### Creature’s Song

Lvl: 5

Diana led the party into the sewers to move through the city quickly and undetected. Along the path, they noticed large tunnels carved into the sewers. Diana saw a flash of a flesh-colored creature, which she threw a bottle of flammable alcohol at. She turned invisible and attempted to track it. She found the creature down one of the tunnels and noticed it had multiple heads.

After returning to the group and discussing it, Diana drew an excellent drawing of what she saw. Leysa recognized the creature as something known as a false hydra. This new knowledge redirected their course to The Legacy Theater, where Diana’s shadow members Kanen and Kaliska Star cared for 20 orphans. Kanen was missing when they arrived, but the orphans and Kaliska were safe and sound.

Kaliska had no idea her brother was missing, which caused Diana to take out her Golden Dragon Statue of True Ressurection and begin the hour-long process of resurrecting Kanen. After the hour, Kanen was brought back to life. The party put earplugs in his ear so he wouldn’t hear the song of the False Hydra. He described how he and Kaliska were ambushed by the False Hydra, and he was eaten by an invisible creature.

Zale contacted Diana at this time, informing her that Vaeri Leowarin, a changeling member of the Avenger, Zale’s pirate ship, had been assassinated by Arlayna. They were heading to Crassus to avenge Vaeri’s death. Diana warned them to stay away until they dealt with the False Hydra.

The party prepared a trap outside a sewer entrance using minor illusion and a dummy, which Diana had secretly filled with alcohol. They waited most of the day before one of its heads peaked out at the dummy. Leysa used one of the cards from her deck of illusions to create an image of a troll. The dummy freaked out at the sight of the troll, while the False Hydra seemed to see it as an illusion.

Zanryn assassinated the head from his perch, and Diana placed a hex on it. Another head came out and bit its dead head off of its body, which Zanryn also assassinated. The remaining attached head was dragged back into the sewers, and the False Hydra disappeared.

The group spent the rest of the day into the night placing alcohol-filled dummies at the entrance to the nine main sewer entrances. While Leysa was placing one in the Shadowend District, the false hydra appeared and ate several people near the sewer entrance, dragging their bodies into the sewer. She alerted Diana, who quickly entered the sewer and was able to hex the aberration before it escaped.

Using Diana’s hex, they tracked which sewer entrances it visited. It went to five of the nine entrances. They also tracked the false hydra to its lair beneath the Shadowend District. The following morning, they made their way to its lair.

Diana began to set a trap in the main room of its lair, which was empty. A large tunnel was dug into the ground inside the room. Leysa, Gurgi, and Zanryn checked one of the adjoining rooms to find another large tunnel from which the false hydra emerged, attacking them. After grappling all three of them with its heads, Derek and Kanen arrived to help. They severed three of its five heads as it slunk back into the tunnel towards the main room, where Diana waited.

Leysa followed it into the tunnel, staying out of sight of its two remaining heads. One of the heads looked as though it was singing. As it crawled back into its main room, Leysa destroyed the water in its eyes and blood vessels, causing one of its heads to fall broken on the ground. The false hydra blindly struggled into its main lair, triggering an acid trap that Diana had set. The acid melted through its remaining form as Diana landed the killing blow with a shot from Firecracker (her pepperbox). Diana threw a bottle of flaming alcohol down on the false hydra’s corpse to make sure it was dead.

Everyone removed their earplugs, finally free of its wretched song. Diana searched the remaining rooms for treasure, finding nothing of note. As she did so, Leysa took out the amulet of Domexius, taken from her dead brother, Helios, over five years ago. It tried to take control of her, but she threw it to the ground. She then hit it with Aeontas’ Battle Pan, which caused cracks across its surface. A voice screamed in everyone’s minds, threatening to kill all of them.

Diana rushed back toward the group as this voice penetrated her mind. Leysa struck it another time, causing the voice to scream in agony. She missed it on her third try as Diana slid around the corner, instinctively plunging Exsoria’s Dagger into the amulet, destroying it. A wave of fire exploded from it as the voice cried out, “I will burn you all.” Both Diana and Leysa were able to emerge unscathed from the flames.

As the party caught their breaths, Leysa noticed a strange shadow that attacked her. She was able to escape its grasp. Leysa recognized it to be a Lesser Umbraki, a creature of pure shadow. They easily destroyed, but two Common Umbraki emerged from either side of the group. Diana and Leysa held them at bay as everyone else escaped.  They dispatched these two with the Driftglobe casting the light spell. A Greater Umbraki emerged, casting darkness on them and extinguishing the light. Diana turned into her wolf form and picked up Leysa, stumbling around the corner out of the darkness.

The Greater Umbraki followed them, casting Dark Star, which caused a crushing gravity and darkness to encompass both of them. Leysa immediately burst into flame as Diana miraculously held onto her ashes, escaping the gravity field and darkness. Leysa quickly reemerged in Diana’s arms, alive but weakened due to her phoenix ring. Diana was able to escape from the Umbraki and the sewers with Leysa in her arms.

The party snuck back to The Legacy Theater, where a swarm of orphans pet Diana in her wolf form, and the party rested for a short while. Their rest was interrupted by a voice calling to them from the outside courtyard, “I bring you joy and great pain.”

Diana recognized the drow outside as Venkalth, Marcaith’s Invoker. Diana jumped off the building into the courtyard and called two wolves to her side. She could see the misty form of her father, Vaserius, in the corner of her eye.

Meanwhile, Leysa and her dire wolf Thor led the orphans to the theater’s attic, where an escape route was placed. Zanryn set up on the roof with his crossbow. Derek and Kanen snuck into a side alleyway as Kaliska slunk to the other side of the courtyard.

Venkalth was joined by two cult acolytes, two cultists, a cult bandit, and a cult thug. As Diana challenged Venkalth, Venkalth’s form shifted into the avatar of Marcaith. Venkalth grew 3 feet taller, and his head morphed into that of a black dragon’s. Venkalth loomed over Diana’s wolf form as the session ended.
