### The Knife Game

Lvl: 9

Professor Fiddlesticks left the party in the morning to head back to Floralus. Diana tied Helios’ hands to a rock. Leysa heated one of Diana’s daggers and then woke up Helios. Diana starts hitting a knife between his fingers. First, he loses his left ring finger, then his right thumb. Leysa begins to question Helios as Diana takes off his left middle finger.

Diana takes off an amulet of Domexius from Helios and becomes paralyzed. Einar fails to slap a paralyzed Diana. Leysa slaps Diana, and Diana comes back to her senses. Diana places it on the ground. Aladus later picks it up with no effect. Helios laughs, and Diana cuts off his left pinky. They discovered Helios was a cult leader for Domexius.

Leysa destroys the water in both of Helios’ eyes. Einar was very impressed with Leysa’s act of violence. Helios reveals that Kaladin is going to a refugee camp and that Kaladin is going to try to recruit a dragon. Katerina then castrated Helios and comment on how it was okay because she is gay.

Leysa asks whether Helios wants to be turned into a deer or a rabbit. He says Deer and Diana then cut out Helios’ tongue. Diana used her wolf amulet to turn into her wolf form. She sees a memory of her father with a group of adventurers. The adventurers are a female changeling wizard, a male tiefling fighter, a male human barbarian, a female halfing bard, a female dragonborn ranger, a male dwarf rogue, and a male half-elf paladin. They are before the king and queen of Staderia, who give them the instructions to go to a land with a volcano to take care of a growing number of undead.

Diana then chased down a polymorphed blind, tongue-less deer version of Helios. Leysa wild shaped into a wolf. Helios face planted into a tree and then ran into a wide-open clearing. After catching Helios and clawing him back into his elf form, Leysa turned back into an elf and placed her boot on Helios. She slowing used a dagger to cut out Helios’ heart as she said, “You stole Mom and Dad’s love for me, so now I’m stealing it back. Diana ripped Helios’ head off his body and gave it to Einar, who put it in Katerina’s bag of holding.

A dust mephit next to a nearby crypt and motioned for Katerina to gamble. They play a game called rollies involving rolling a d20. He lost the first two times. He told them that the gods created the plague. He also tells them that a possessed woman named Karen has captured the town of New Aurelia.

Katerina lost, and decided to shoot the dust mephit. Diana calmed the situation and the dust mephit told her of a group of adventurers went to Thanatos but never returned. He snuck back into the crypt, slammed the door behind him, and never wants to play rollies with Katerina again..

Diana and Katerina then took a shot of vodka. Diana became a bit woozy. Katerina became completely drunk.

Diana gained one point of corruption.

  

### New Aurelia

Lvl: 9

Diana, Leysa, and Aladus start to head down to scout out the city. They make Aladus stay behind as he starts strumming the mission impossible theme on her lute. Diana and Leysa approach a group of soldiers from Carelia led by Captain Valorum that the King and Queen sent before their deaths. They had finished killing a group of zombies.

Meanwhile, drunk Katerina tried to kiss Einar, who stopped her. “We’re not there yet.”

Diana and Leysa enter the city with the soldiers. Karen the possessed with a horde of undead, including a necromancer, passed through the town square and entered Castle Aurelia. The party meets up in the Rusty Cauldron and spends the night in the inn. Diana sleeps in for longer than the party.

The party sneaks into the castle as the Carelian soldiers siege the front of the castle. A large horde of undead rushes from the castle to meet the Carelians. The party snuck past a stable with three guard drakes and a guard into the castle. Einar, Katerina, and Aladus explore one hallway, running into a room with a chest and two zombies. Katerina touches the chest and it is revealed it is a mimic. Katerina barely escapes as her and Einar slam the door on them, cutting one of the zombie’s arms off.

Diana, Leysa, and Gurgi search for the treasure room. They find the great hall, which has four ghouls, a ghast, a skeleton archer, and a set of dinosaur bones. Meanwhile, the other part of the group found the treasure room with four ghouls and a ghast. Einar rages and charges the nearest ghoul. After a short scuffle, including Einar shattering one of her javelins, they kill the ghouls and ghast.

Katerina finds an arrow of dragon slaying. Einar finds a chest mimic, which they kill after it consumes one of Katerina’s shortswords. Einar then finds the sunblade and wings of flying. Einar later gives the wand of binding to Leysa.

The group regroups near the entryway, where Leysa gets possessed by a ghost. They also were attacked by two skeletons with two boneless attached. Einar defeats them by using the horn of life, which destroys the ghost inside Leysa after attacking her only hurt Leysa.

The party then snuck down the halls to the throne room. Inside, Karen stood with a guard drake, two guards, and two zombies. After an intense battle, Katerina fired the final shot at Karen, which went through both of her eyeballs.

Katerina found studded leather with necrotic resistance. The party then left the castle to find ten guards, two knights, and Commander Valorum victorious over the horde of undead.
