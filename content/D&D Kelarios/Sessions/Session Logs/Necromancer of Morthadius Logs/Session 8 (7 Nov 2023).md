### Diana’s Birthday

Lvl: 11

As they enter Staderia, it is Diana’s birthday. They spend the day shopping. They resupply with various potions and a javelin to replace Einar’s broken javelin. Katerina buys a diamond ring for Einar. Leysa bought diamonds for the revivify spell. Diana purchases various poisons, a gray bag of tricks, a couple silver daggers, a ring of fire resistance, and leg bones. Leysa bought a disguise kit, a staff of healing, and a ring of spell storing with two unknown spells (One 1st lvl, One 2nd lvl). They are also told by the general store keeper that there is an execution that night.

Katerina convinced Reggie the half-elf alchemist to buy a nonmagical locket for 200 gold with help from Diana after convincing him it holds memories. Katerina also sold a pair of regular bone dice as magical dice by having them whisper his wife is cheating on him. Little did the party know, his wife was cheating on him with a man named Yamesin, who Diana agreed to assassinate and bring back his eyes for 5000 gold. Diana told Reggie what truly happened in Carelia for 2500 platinum.

Katerina fails to sell “magical” rations and Reggie kicks her out. Katerina leaves, takes off her dragonborn ring, and walks back in as a tiefling. Reggie doesn’t recognize Katerina as the same person. Katerina sells the cultist robe of Marcaith as an invisibility cloak for humans, but they can’t take it off.

Katerina tried to kiss Einar, who did not want to kiss her, but Gurgi pushed Einar into kissing Katerina right after they left the alchemist’s shop. Diana and Einar leave to get tattoos. Einar gets a tattoo of a lute and a flute on her left bicep. Diana gets a tattoo of a stylized moon with clouds on her right shoulder.

Katerina went to the Dancing Dragon tavern and learned from Sovia the barkeep that her husband Jowell was scheduled to be executed at sunset for being an accomplice in Prince Dorian’s murder. Katerina used her earring to tell the others. Diana finds Horus, Osian’s hawk, and sends a message for the Lunar Pack to save Jowell.

Katerina asked for the strongest alcohol, dragonblood, for 10 gold. She takes it to a group of four tavern goers and sets five shots of dragonblood down. Katerina used her charlatan’s dice to gamble in a drinking game. One by one, three of them passed out due to the dragonblood shots. One gave up after the third one lost and he left the tavern. A half-orc joined her at the table, after she looted the three losers. The half-orc lost and passed out. Another half-orc sees her try to loot him and stops her from doing so.

Leysa walked into the Temple of Aeontas, a beautiful temple with intricate columns. Priests walk in silver robes. The high priest stood before a basin of silver liquid wearing an intricate silver robe. He gives a cup of the silver liquid to Leysa, which tastes really sweet. She sits down at a silver church pew. A warm sensation washes over her and Leysa finds herself in a silver room with a high elf in a silver robe with a trimmed beard and long hair. Leysa approaches the god of eternity, Aeontas, seeking answers about Diana’s secrets.

Aeontas tells her Diana is doing what she sees as the best for Leysa, although Aeontas does not approve of her methods. He tells her to ask Einar or Katerina about what happened in Killden and Carelia. He also tells her that she could help Diana out by casting greater restoration on her. Aeontas also tells her to be cautious about her secret book. Leysa asked if her parents were at peace, and he says that they are. Helios’ path is a bit different than theirs. He comments on how brutal his death was and then welcomes Leysa back as he sends her back to the pew. Time was different in that realm and it lasted hours in real life.

Katerina went to the tattoo shop and had Einar come out to help her put the ring back on. Katerina put the ring of the chromatic dragon back on and it immediately shot off her finger dealing psychic damage. The second time, it shoots off again. She tried it again and this time she turned into a copper dragonborn and kept her wits about her.

### The Execution

Leysa and Gurgi walked out of the Temple of Aeontas into the town square right into where the execution was set up. The sun was beginning to set. There is a large crowd gathered around a stand with four hangman nooses in front of four people. King Averus Mila, Queen Erivela Milas, and Princess Adarla Milas are on a separate platform, watching the spectacle with two knights guarding them.

Sheriff Revalin Hadeon sees Leysa and begins small talk with her. He puts his arm around Leysa, who shoves his arm away. She tells Sheriff Hadeon she doesn’t like executions. He then persuades her to leave the execution with him. Gurgi successfully steals one of Leysa’s earrings and warns the others through it of Leysa’s predicament (Gurgi’s 2nd Nat 20). Gurgi runs off trying to find them (Nat 1) and has no idea where to go as he runs off in the completely opposite direction.

Katerina starts running toward the town square. Diana climbs onto the rooftops rushing toward the square. Einar sounds off the horn of life, which those at the square hear. Sheriff Hadeon increases his speed at the sound, leading Leysa further away from the town square. Meanwhile, Diana sees Tariq Williams drinking the blood of a woman in an alleyway.

Katerina makes it to the edge of the square and shouts that she killed Prince Dorian while holding his head. A group of guards led by a knight and Princess Adarla pursue her into an alleyway.

Leysa mentions where she’s walking into her earring, when Sheriff Hadeon asks who she is talking to, she tells him she is talking to her friends. He takes her remaining earring and puts it in his pocket.

Einar makes it to the square and looks for Leysa, but is unable to see her through the gathered crowd. Diana moves past the alleyway with Tariq, who sees her. She flips him off as she jumps past. Diana summons three wolves as she howls, who she sends to find Leysa. In her mind, she sees the resurrection ritual of Eria, the halfling bard by her father Vaserius. When she returns to the present moment, she is clutching the side of the roof she was jumping too. She is able to climb up, only to come face to face with Tariq, who magically charms her. She is guided along the roof by Tariq and sees the woman now dead below.

Katerina hides in a house down the alleyway and locks the door behind her. Adarla and the knight with their guards rush past the door. Einar looks at the hangman’s platform and sees Jowell Revalus the Firebrand with three others. The others are Syriel Winters, Koa Fern, and Alinda Smalls, three people that were falsely accused due to the actions of Diana. Einar uses her lightning breath to electrify two guards and the executioner to death. Multiple people rush forward from the crowd, including Osian, Diana’s half-brother, and Khetra Longleaf, his father. A necromancer reveals herself and kills a few members of the Lunar Pack.

Tariq tells Diana to come to Dawnwind the next day. Tariq then turns into a bat and flies away.

Sheriff Hadeon takes a gate stone out of his pocket, which begins to glow. The wolves and Gurgi rush toward Leysa’s location. Einar throws a bead of force towards the royal platform, trapping the King and the necromancer in a ball of force.

Diana tries to convince Sheriff Hadeon to duel her tomorrow and release Leysa, but he doesn’t bite. He says that he’ll see Diana tomorrow anyway. He then drops the earring on the ground.

Katerina drinks a potion of gaseous form and starts to slowly guide down the alleyway.

Sheriff Hadeon leads Leysa into a building and closes the door behind her. The gate stone glowed even brighter in his hand. Einar mentions to Osian that Sheriff Hadeon has Leysa and he takes off after her. Diana makes it to the square, ask Einar where Osian is and then chases after him.

Katerina sees Einar and turns back into herself. Einar is amazed by Katerina appearing out of mist and thinks back to the kiss from earlier. Einar and Katerina get on their horses and rush toward the tavern with Jowell, those they freed, and most of the Lunar Pack.

A guard stops Diana near the town well and asks her where she’s going. She lies and says the Temple of Aeontas as she has been traumatized. He says, “fair enough” and let’s her past. Gurgi finds Leysa’s earring and two of the wolves start trying to get past the door and Sheriff Hadeon and locks the door. Gurgi tries to open the door.

The gate stone glows a deep violet and Sheriff Hadeon and Leysa vanish with a flash. Leysa sees the decrepit ruins of Dawnwind, the old capital of the Shiye Tribe. Leysa can tell Dawnwind Keep is the residence of a vampire. Tariq welcomes them to the castle, holding a glass of wine. Leysa recognizes Tariq from the ball at Carelia. Next to Tariq is a female vampire spawn. Leysa has a wonderful dinner at Dawnwind.

Einar and Katerina arrive at the Dancing Dragon tavern, where Jowell reuinites with Sovia. They quickly leave the tavern.

Diana makes it to Gurgi, who is holding up Leysa’s earring of message. The party rides through the night to Thornhall, where Diana’s mother greets them. Diana explains the situation. Diana then takes Leysa’s secret book and heads into the woods. She opens the book and becomes chaotic evil. She gains another corruption point. Diana turns the page and gains an indefinite madness and further corruption. She reads the plague’s origins and only Diana learns the origins. Diana’s eyes change from a warm gold to a dark gold color. Her hair also has a few gray streaks.
