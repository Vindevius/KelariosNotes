### Escaping the Cave

Lvl: 6

The party pushed onward, Diana unlocking the door to the rest of the cave system. Three chests were up against the wall of the next room. Upon entering, Diana perceived that there was something off about the third chest. They looted the first two chests, and then Einar, against what Diana told her, picked up the third chest, which started to stick to her. Einar, however, was able to throw it away from her before the mimic that was now before them was able to glue itself to her. After a brief battle involving Einar taking out both of its eyes with a rusty longsword, she used that same longsword to cleave its top half off, killing it. The rusty longsword shattered in the process, leaving a shard the size of a dagger behind.

Leysa went in a different direction and found a statue of a duergar. She activated a trap, causing it to breathe fire, which she was able to dodge enough to limit the fire damage. The party, down a narrow hallway, faced a gelatinous cube. Through the combined help of Diana’s flammable alcohol and Leysa’s control fire, they set the cube on fire. Katerina further stroked the fire, and Einar lost her rusty dagger in the flames of the cube. Leysa hurt the cube, and Diana and Einar with her thunder wave. After the cube tried to engulf Leysa, Diana shot a crossbow bolt into the cube, and it burst into flames.

In the next room, Leysa negotiated with some confused duergar, which pointed the way out and warned them of a scything blade trap. The duergar stabbed and killed the charmed bandit captain, and Diana disabled the trap. In the next room, they found four pairs of blue crystal earrings of message, which will allow them to communicate when apart.

As they exited the cave, a poisoned crossbow bolt rendered Leysa unconscious. Einar shook the assassin out of the tree and pinned him to the ground with her javelin. Aladus stabilized Leysa. Diana and Einar rendered the assassin unconscious by stabbing his eye and breaking both of his legs. They tied him up and took him with them. Diana found a note detailing the assassin’s target (Leysa) and the reward (50,000 gold). It also mentioned further employment and was signed H.D.

That night, Diana interrogated the assassin, named Mathias, with him tied to a tree. He tried to lie about how long he was following them, but Diana saw through his lie. He had been following them for a week since they left Staderia. After torture, Diana let Einar rip Mathias’ head off with her bare hands. Einar kept his head. Diana left his headless body on the nearby road.

  

### The Refugee Camp

Lvl: 6 (1:57:50)

The next day, they came upon a refugee camp from New Aurelia. Brom, their leader, a bronze dragonborn, describes the wretched state of New Aurelia. He asks for them to get help from Carelia. Brom recognizes Einar as he knew her parents when they were alive. Her parents, Antares and Auriga, were bards who played the lute, the flute, and the tute. Einar asked a lot about her parents, who she knew little about. Brom shares her hatred for Kaladin.

Katerina and Leysa used the orb of Vizoia to heal those inflicted with the plague in the refugee camp. Diana found one-eyed Derek, a fellow criminal member, who rejoiced that Prince Dorian was dead. He called Prince Dorian the worst elvish cuss word (Havaesa). Derek agreed to meet her in Killden, the undercity of Carelia, in a couple of days. Diana contemplated robbing a tent but decided not to rob the poor refugees. Einar gave 30 gold to Brom to help the refugees.

  

### Carelia & Killden

Lvl: 6-7 (2:20:29)

The party made it to Carelia toward the end of the day. Diana gave the secret handshake to the bandit guards and gained access to Killden. Killden is a small city completely under the southern district of Carelia. There is no sky in Killden. They made their way to Killden’s Blood, the tavern, and paid for a room at its inn. Diana hangs around in the tavern as everyone else makes their way to their room.

After talking to the drow barkeep, Diana is told about a noble-looking high elf at the bar who gave access to the underground to Helios, which is against the thieves’ creed of Killden. No one paid much attention to it.

Diana persuaded the entire tavern and, in conjunction, Killden, to rise up against the Carelian nobles. As she did, she slit the throat of the high elf. After this, the drow barkeep and the tavern patrons repeated, “More blood for Killden.”

Diana’s plan includes killing Prince Helios, King Arwan, and Queen Elowen, but not Princess Leysa. There was already a bounty for the King and Queen. This plan will occur during the masquerade ball at the end of the week.

When Diana returned to the room, she brought Einar partially into the plan, telling her to knock Leysa out during the ball to save her from witnessing her parents’ death.

The next day, they explored Killden. They purchased various items at an underground magic shop run by a half-orc. Aladus, now in the form of a half-orc, buys the shopkeeper multiple drinks at the tavern. Katerina starts to gamble, but the dealer is suspicious of her, so Einar drags her away. Aladus teaches Katerina and Einar how to dance. As they dance, Katerina swoons and stumbles for Einar. Einar is too focused on learning the dance to notice.

Meanwhile, Diana and Leysa visit the temple of Domexius, the god of dominion. They talk to a priest with a golden cloak with the sign of a sun on the back. He tries to convert them but fails. Diana mentions Helios, who is a leader in the cult of Domexius. The priest offers to give a message to Helios to meet up with Diana possibly. The priest asks Diana to keep Leysa away from her.

Leysa persuaded Diana to visit the other temple in Killden, the temple of Exsoria, the goddess of exile and misfortune. The temple looks gothic and tomb-like, made of black stone. Leysa wants to turn back, but Diana says they’d come this far. They see a priestess in dark robes at the entrance of the temple, who beckons them to enter.

Inside is a long, dark, black stone hallway with blue braziers at even intervals. At the end of the hall is a room where the short priestess stands behind an altar, watching them. Diana speaks in thieves’ cant to avoid Leysa understanding. Diana asks for advice.

The priestess says Exsoria welcomes Diana. She creates a blue flame in a bowl on the altar. She whispered something unintelligible in the flames. Behind her, a violet portal appeared. Diana walked through the portal, which vanished.

Leysa asks the priestess where Diana went. The priestess simply said, “She walks the path of the exiles.” Leysa asks if she can walk the path. The priestess tells her she can’t at this point and asks her to leave.

Meanwhile, back in the room, Einar and Katerina are dancing. Katerina stumbled into Einar’s arms and looked up at her. Einar stared into her eyes and began to feel an attraction toward Katerina. Aladus was in the corner playing a waltz on his lute. Gurgi tried to push Einar and Katerina together to have them kiss, but Einar just kicked him away.

Diana found herself in a hallway that opened into a wide cavern. At the end of the cavern was a raised platform with a set of stairs leading up to it. Behind a large altar was a being in a dark cloak. As Diana watched, this woman’s features continuously change between the races. One moment, she is an elf; the next, a Dragonborn; and the next, a tiefling. A feeling of intense fear almost consumed Diana, but she was able to shake it away. The being beckoned for Diana to approach.

Diana slowly approached the altar and noticed that the entity was three or four feet taller than her. The being, Exsoria, the goddess of exile and misfortune, forced Diana to kneel at the altar. She called Diana by name, telling her she knows the names of all the exiles. Exsoria shows affection like that toward a valued servant toward Diana.

Exsoria remarks on how Diana still doesn’t believe in her, even while she stands in front of her. Diana comments on how it’s hard to believe in something since her father disappeared. Exsoria revealed that Diana’s father is not dead, just lost his way. She also reveals her father, Vaserius, is near Carelia. Exsoria creates a violet orb. Within the orb, Exsoria reveals her father in a brown cloak in the forest.

Diana instinctively reached for the Wolf Amulet that her father gave her. Exsoria asks if she knows what it does yet. The knowledge of the Wolf Amulet fills Diana’s mind. It has three abilities. One summons a pack of wolves. Another gives her domain over hounds. Finally, the third allows her to morph into a wolf form. As she triggers these abilities, Diana sees a memory of her father. Diana sees in her mind the memory of her father leaving.

Exsoria tells Diana that they walk the path of the exiles to survive. Exsoria gently commands Diana to pledge herself to her and the path of the exiles. Diana asks for advice first regarding her betrayal of Leysa involving the plans to murder her family. Exsoria’s advice isn’t rather helpful, as she agrees with what Diana has already chosen, remarking on how stubborn Diana is. Her only advice is not to deal the death blow.

Diana agrees to pledge herself to Exsoria as Exsoria creates a bowl of blue fire. Before Diana places her hands in the fire, she said, “With great knowledge comes great sacrifice.” The fire burns for a moment, and the flames enwrap Diana, and she is taken back to the mortal realm. Tattooed on her upper left arm is a black snake with violet eyes. The priestess in the temple of Exsoria welcomes her to the fold and beckons her to leave. Diana is no longer an atheist.

Diana searches for Leysa, who was lost down a random tunnel outside of Killden. Leysa asked what happened, but Diana did not reveal anything. They then return to Killden’s Blood, where Diana and Leysa drank vodka. Leysa gets drunk and reveals the dark secret book she holds to Diana, who convinces Leysa to let her hold on to it.

Diana also creates a magical binding contract with drunk Leysa with the help of Katerina, who dragged Einar along for it. The following is the contract:

- Leysa will never step foot into Carelia after the masquerade ever again.
    
- Leysa will rule Staderia and will see it as the right thing to do.
    
- Leysa will never ask Diana about the bloodshed.
    
- Know that Diana did everything out of love and safety for Leysa.
    
- Diana will not interfere if Leysa go after Sheriff Hadeon but still may try to kill him to honor her family.
    

After Leysa goes to bed, Derek walks in. Diana explains the regicide plan to him, and he agrees to take part in it. He justifies killing the king and queen based on how close to death they already are. Derek recounts to them how he lost his eye to Kaladin. Einar and Derek bond over wanting to kill Kaladin.

Diana asks about the possibility of a vampire being at the masquerade. Derek reveals that Tariq, Diana’s ex-lover, will be at the masquerade. He also reveals that Tariq has been living in the ruins of Dawnwind, the old capital of the Shiye. Diana asks Derek to kill Tariq if he gets the chance. Derek remarked on how difficult killing a vampire is. Diana flatters Derek by saying he’s one of the best.

Diana notices that Derek also has a tattoo of a black snake with violet eyes. Diana reveals her tattoo to him, and he remarks that she is touched by the goddess, which confuses Einar and Katerina, who did not see the tattoo. The party then went to bed.

In the morning, Katerina is cuddled up next to Einar. Leysa does not remember anything in the morning and is suffering from a massive hangover. She will reconsider drinking alcohol from now on. She also notices that her secret book is gone but is unable to find it. Leysa then questioned Diana further about her disappearance in the temple of Exsoria. Diana mentioned something about her dad and an emotional breakdown. Leysa asked if she needs a hug, and she declined quickly.

The party went shopping for dresses for the masquerade ball. Diana sits around, as she has her dress from Thornhall, as the others try on dresses for about an hour and a half. Aladus changed into a half-elf woman to help them try on dresses. Einar picked the first emerald dress that she saw. Leysa’s dress is light blue with gold accents. She also bought blue flats. Leysa asked Diana about her wolf amulet, which Diana told her about. Katerina took a while but eventually chose an ivory dress with pearl beading and a pair of shoes.

They visit Castle Carelia. Aladus changes into a blond half-elf pretending to be Diana’s brother, and Diana disguises herself with the alias “Amelia.” The guards allow them in to see King Arwan and Queen Elowen, Leysa’s parents. Leysa convinced them to take the bounty down for Diana kidnapping Leysa, as she did not actually do that. Both the King and Queen are old and sickly. They only have a few years to live max.

Leysa’s old teacher, Professor Fiddlesticks, is visiting and ecstatically greets Leysa. He leads her back to see her elephant, Jane. Fiddlesticks has a crystal called the Raven’s Slumber, which is able to capture Jane inside it. While Jane is within the crystal, she can look out of it like a window. Fiddlesticks also give them a map of the castle.

Leysa gathers expensive items from her room and allows the others to do so as well. Only Diana declines. As they leave, Professor Fiddlesticks gives the bracer of flying daggers, which he was working on in his workshop, to Leysa, who then gives it to Diana. Once outside the castle, Diana takes off her disguise.

The party arrives at a tavern called Xanaphia’s Meadery across from the castle and pays for a room for the next three nights. Diana slips out and rides Nightmare out into the woods north of Carelia.

At the tavern, Einar teaches Katerina how to play cards, and both of them swoon for each other. Leysa and Gurgi go for a walk in the large city square between the tavern and the castle. Aladus is flirting with a half-elf woman at the bar.

Out in the woods, Diana howls into the night. A memory of her father plays through her mind. Diana sees Vaserius with a group of half-elves and humans walking away from Staderia next to the nearby lake. They encounter a group of undead, and a few of them are killed in the battle. The image of her father fades. As it does so, six wolves approach Diana and look up at her expectantly.

Diana asks the wolves to help her find her father. The wolves lead her a half hour into the forest to a large clearing. A man is at the other edge of the clearing, cloaked in brown. Diana dismounts Nightmare and slowly crosses the clearing. She calls out to him, saying, “I’m not mad, Papi.”

As she speaks, he cocks his head as if confused. Diana continues, “So much has happened. Mother thought you died. I wasn’t sure what to believe. I started a whole war just for revenge for you. I thought you were gone.”

Diana stopped about fifteen feet away from him. “Why did you never let yourself be known to us?”

Vaserius stood silently before her. Diana could see tears under his hood. He waved his hand, and a violet portal appeared next to him. He walked through it and disappeared.

“Of course, I was a fool to think you actually cared.” She then slowly walked back to Nightmare and the wolves. She thanked the wolves and released them. They disappeared into the woods with a mournful howl. Diana returned to the tavern to drown herself in alcohol.

Over the course of the next few days leading up to the masquerade ball, the party planned and plotted for the ball after Diana recovered from her hangover, of course.
