### Pyora & Umbralion

Lvl: 13-15

The party learn about the deathlocks and the legend of where the Dragonslayer sword is located on the Isle of Vectalix. Katerina gambles as per usual. After attempting to get drunk, Diana went into a room with Aladus, which she enjoyed more that she would like to admit. Leysa gets Diana drunk enough to pass out. Derek then chains Diana up as Leysa casts Balor, a shadow demon that was influencing Diana, out of her. The party, minus Diana who was cussing up a storm, were able to defeat Balor.

The party travels to the town of Pyora, following Umbralion’s trail. They find his lair north of the town inside a barren hill.

Inside, they stumble upon a ritual in a dark cavern in the Underdark that turned Umbralion into a dracolich, which they are unable to stop. They kill the cultists involved and engage in an extended battle with Umbralion. Umbralion is dangerous, but Einar managed to behead the dracolich and destroy the phylactery housing his soul.

Shortly after, Narmok appeared wearing a mask atop a blue dracolich named Alvodra. He raised multiple undead, including the corpse of Aladus’ former body. These skeletons captured the party, except Gurgi, who managed to escape into the Underdark. Leysa escaped from the skeletons, but was brought down quickly through an arcane burst from Narmok and a lightning blast from Alvodra. Einar was able to break free as well, only for Narmok to cast hold person on her.

Leysa was left to die as the rest of the party was thrown in a prison cell. Diana was taken separately to a prison cell in Narmok’s personal chamber that canceled any magic. Narmok entered shortly after, and sent away Diana’s guards. He exclaimed how she shouldn’t have come and revealed himself to be Vaserius, Diana’s father. He mention how it took all of his willpower to fight his staff, the Staff of Morthadius, and stop himself from killing his own daughter. He also reveals that Cloaky is actually the mind of Dumilus trapped inside Dumilus’ invisibility cloak. Vaserius couldn’t save any of his companions bodies when they face Balor, the original champion of Morthadius. Instead, Vaserius bound each of their minds to their magical items.

Narmok/Vaserius tossed Diana the key to her cell and left before the staff made him kill her. Leysa recovered from her near death experience, and tracked her way into the complex.

Narmok then went to the rest of the party, revealed the Orb of Vizoia, and destroyed it with a +3 mace. Leysa tried to stop him, but Narmok cast hold person and put her in the cell with her friends, without taking her weapons away. Narmok saw that Einar had the Horn of Life and attempted to do the same thing. Diana, who snuck her way toward the cell, tried to use mage hand to recover the Horn of Life before the final blow, but Narmok was able to hit it one last time, causing the horn to explode, destroying all weak nearby undead. Narmok dimension doored away with his deathlock wight.

The party heard an explosion toward the entrance to the cavern and found the path to be blocked. They were able to clear a bit of the rubble away, but saw Alvodra’s head on the other side, who shot a line of lightning through all of them. They were able to recover from the encounter and moved into the Underdark.
