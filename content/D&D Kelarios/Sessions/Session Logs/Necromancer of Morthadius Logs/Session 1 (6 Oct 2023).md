### The Maluculi Den

Lvl: 1-3

The party consisting of Diana Moonstone, Einar the Enforcer, Katerina Petrova, and Leysa Doyle found themselves in front of the entrance to a maluculi den. It was raining softly outside as they entered the cave. Inside, they followed the tunnel to a wide hole in the ground covered by rotting wooden planks. On the other side of the pit was a dead end.

Leysa, who was not paying attention, stepped into the hole. If it weren’t for Einar’s quick reflexes and strength, Leysa would have fallen straight into the pit. Diana took her rope and wrapped it around a sturdy board. They descended into the cavern below. Diana led the way, followed by Katerina, who wanted to ensure it was safe for her crush, Einar. Leysa came falling down after her. Katerina was able to catch Leysa the clutz. Einar was last, almost losing her grip on the rope.

In the next room, they found 3 maluculi, which they were able to kill easily. The cave system split into four different paths. One on the left was too small for them and could only fit maluculi. Einar and Katerina took the path straight forward. Diana sneaked down the path to the right of them. Leysa took the path furthest to the right by herself.

Einar and Katerina noticed a falling debris trap on a tunnel splitting to the left, which Katerina disabled with an arrow. This caused the three maluculi in the room past that trap to come and attack them. Einar kicked the first one, causing it and the third maluculi to fall prone. The second maluculi was able to dodge out of the way. After a short battle in the hall, Einar and Katerina dispatched the three maluculi. Einar crushed one of their skulls with her foot. Katerina found a mystery key on a human corpse in that room.

Meanwhile, Diana snuck up to 2 maluculi chewing on a human corpse and looted the corpse while they were eating it, finding a potion of greater healing. She snuck back towards the others, where she heard Leysa in the room over trying to make friends with a single maluculi chewing on a bone. The maluculi seemed confused by this. After Leysa tried to take control of his blood, he swung his bone at her. Diana came into the room and killed the maluculi.

The group met up outside the hallway with the falling debris trap. They quickly split up again. Einar and Katerina took the next left turn in the main tunnel. Diana and Leysa took the next left after that.

Einar and Katerina rushed down the hall, setting off a hallway of arrow traps, which they didn’t even notice. They barged right into the center gathering point of the den, where four maluculi were gathered around a small pool of water. Three more maluculi were on a ledge on the left next to an altar.

After a lengthy battle, Einar and Katerina succeeded in killing all seven maluculi in a bloody fashion. Katerina had to fish out of the now bloody pool Einar’s javelin. Einar was not impressed, but she found a powerful mace on the altar.

Diana and Leysa had an easier time. They snuck past two maluculi. Diana looted a potion of healing off of the elf corpse they were eating. The two groups saw each other down a hallway but continued on down separate hallways that connected up ahead.

Einar and Katerina set off a crushing wall trap, but we’re able to get past it. Katerina noticed it, but Einar was completely oblivious of it.

In the next room, they killed two more maluculi. Diana snuck down a tunnel on the right, finding a potion of healing on a human corpse another maluculi was eating. Diana is very sneaky. She snuck back toward the group.

The rest of the group went down a tunnel on the left. Einar found a cloak of many fashions and 4 platinum pieces on an elf corpse.

Diana rejoined the group before they killed an additional three maluculi in the next cave room. Diana found dust of disappearance in a hidden chest. Diana, followed by Leysa, found what looked like a lump down the left tunnel leading forward. The lump was a large maluculi that Diana then murdered. She looted a key off of its body. Einar and Katerina took the tunnel to the right, and the two groups rejoined further in.

Diana used the key to unlock a door to the den’s treasure horde of three chests. The first chest contained gems, coins, and a dread helm. Gurgi popped out of the second chest, tackling Diana. Leysa instantly befriended Gurgi by giving him munchings and crunchings. Inside the chest were more gems, coins, a clockwork amulet, a potion of clairvoyance, and an elixir of health. The final chest had gems, coins, a wand of secrets, and oil of etherealness.

Further down the hallway, past a room of bedrolls, Diana noticed something strange about the cave wall. She and Einar were unable to open it, but Katerina was able to kick into it. Inside was a Mithral breastplate, which Katerina put on.

The party made it to the final room. Inside, four maluculi, one in a dark cloak with a scythe, were gathered around an orb on an altar. Inside the orb is a mist that swirls around. It glows a beautiful green. The cloaked maluculi speaks to the three about Narmok, an unfamiliar name to the party, being displeased if they were to lose this orb.

Diana failed to sneak attack one of the maluculi. The party, however, easily defeated the three maluculi minions. After a brief fight with the maluculi necromancer, dodging his scythe, Einar was able to pin him to the wall with her javelin. She then beheaded him to take his head as a trophy.

Diana picked up the orb, which she learned was the orb of Vizoia, the goddess of life. When activated, it creates a healing sphere where the party rests at double the speed. It also detects necrotic energy and gives the user resistance to necrotic damage. Diana and the party use it immediately for a short, 30-minute rest.

The party easily left the den, avoiding the few survivors. All of them climbed up the rope out of the pit. Leysa launched herself up it, which led to Einar wondering why she couldn’t do that while going down the rope.

### Staderia

Lvl: 3

The party left the forest and entered the city of Staderia. They sold and bought things at the general store, also asking Zorthia, the dwarf shopkeeper, for information. Specifically about Sheriff Hadeon and Kaladin, Diana’s and Einar’s nemeses, respectively. Katerina also tried to buy a diamond ring but did not have enough gold for it. Leysa bought an apple for Gurgi, who craves munchings and crunchings.

Diana and Einar went towards the Dancing Dragon Tavern on the lookout for Sheriff Hadeon, while Katerina and Leysa went to visit Katerina’s sick parents.

Katerina and Leysa stopped by her brother Marcel’s blacksmith, where she found her brother. Marcel quickly led them to her parents in their rundown shack as their health condition had worsened. Katerina’s parents, Marcon and Ora, are sick in bed, babbling about undead armies and necromancers.

After a bit of debate on healing them, Katerina uses the elixir of health, which cures the plague in Ora, her mother. She doesn’t have enough for her father. They rush out of there to get the orb from Diana at the tavern.

Meanwhile, Diana and Einar are unable to find Sheriff Hadeon in the Dancing Dragon. They ask the barkeep, Sovia, a female half-elf. She tells them that both Sheriff Hadeon and Kaladin were just there. She overheard them talking about something in Carelia and finding something at the tomb of Gorlath before anyone else. Barkeeps hear everything. The party also learns that some demonic entity has taken over New Aurelia, and eastern Staderia is falling to the same plague Katerina’s family has.

Meanwhile, a handsome, charismatic man with a crow stops Leysa and begins to flirt with her. Katerina finds it entertaining, so she doesn’t intervene. He convinces Leysa to let him buy her a nonalcoholic drink at the Dancing Dragon since both of them are heading there. Once they arrive, Katerina finds Einar and Diana. Leysa, however, doesn’t see them and goes to another part of the bar with this man, who buys her a drink. After he does so, he leaves Leysa, who is now charmed by him. Leysa finds the rest of them, and Diana acknowledges that she’s blushing. Diana is furious as soon as Leysa describes the man. She has the barkeep show a poster of Sheriff Hadeon, and Leysa lovingly admits that’s the man.

Diana investigates outside the tavern and follows crow feathers toward the west docks to catch Sheriff Hadeon. The rest of the party returns to Katerina’s parents with the orb of Vizoia. The orb’s green light encapsulates Marcon and heals him. They learn that this orb is able to cure the plague.

Einar gifts the head of the maluculi necromancer to Katerina’s parents, who thank her profusely. Marcon even puts it on a shelf. Marcon explains how Kaladin, the red Dragonborn, used a scythe to give him the plague after he discovered the secret base of the Cult of Marcaith. He sends them to their hideout in the west docks.

### Cult of Marcaith

Lvl: 3

Diana regroups with the party outside of a warehouse in the west docks. Diana arrived after the group saw Sheriff Hadeon walk inside. They sneak in through a window and find a trap door, which leads into the Cult of Marcaith.

Diana snuck past the black-robed cultist in the first room. Einar, however, made her cloak of many fashions look like the cultist's robes and walked up to the cultist. Einar learned from the cultist, who believed her to be one of them, that Kaladin was on his way to the Tomb of Gorlath to take a valuable artifact out of it before anyone else is able to. Einar’s conversation with the cultist enables both Katerina and Leysa to sneak past him. Katerina snuck into the room to the right, where she found three silver jugs. Diana snuck straight ahead, sneaking past another two cultists. Leysa, with Gurgi, snuck down the hallway to the left and past a couple of cultists at a table. She found a potion of healing in an adjoining room.

Katerina snuck past four cultists eating dinner and into a round room with a desk in the middle. She finds a spell scroll, two potions of climbing, a gold locket, and two charlatan’s dice on the desk. As soon as she picks up the dice, she rushes out of the room, barely escaping the exploding desk trap that she triggered by picking up the dice. She is able to sneak past the cultists eating dinner, who are now alerted to the explosion.

Leysa marched down a hallway, which triggered a poison dart trap that stuck a dart in her neck. She was able to shake off the poison and sneak past the first cultist. Leysa, however, was unable to sneak past the two cultists in the next room but was able to convince them that she was trying to find Sheriff Hadeon. The two confused cultists pointed the way for her to go.

The group meets up in a more central room in the hideout. Diana leads the way further into the hideout into a room of boxes. Einar fails to break open a heavy box that she picked up. Katerina, however, was able to open a box with platinum coins inside.

Diana easily snuck past the two cultists in the next room, along with Katerina, but Einar and Leysa were unable to sneak past. The cultists were unconvinced of their story that Einar was a member of the cult. Einar bonked their heads together and rendered both cultists unconscious. She then hid them in a big box in the room.

Diana stepped into the next room and was hit by a poison dart, which poisoned her. In the next and final room, Diana sees Sheriff Hadeon and cusses at him, giving away their position. In the room with him were a Cultist Necromancer, a cult fanatic, and two cultists. After a short exchange of words and Sheriff Hadeon flirting with Leysa, they begin to fight. The first chance Sheriff Hadeon gets, he flees up a stairwell in the corner. Diana calls him a coward.

Einar is able to frighten all of the remaining cultists. Even Sheriff Hadeon’s voice could be heard cursing up the stairwell. Leysa decapitated one with her battle pan, whose head hit the necromancer in the face. Diana tried to get to Sheriff Hadeon, but cultists kept getting in her way. Katerina landed the final shot on the necromancer, and the battle was over. Einar decapitated the necromancer’s head as a trophy.

Diana led the way up the stairwell, which led to the water’s edge next to an empty dock.
