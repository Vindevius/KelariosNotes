Lvl: 12-14

Diana finds Anubis, Sheriff Hadeon’s crow, clutched dead in Horus’ claws. She gives him to her mother to make a delicious stew.

Diana returned to Dawnwind for her silver dagger and Sheriff Hadeon’s pepperbox. She finds the letter she sent Tariq when she broke up with him. A letter that Tariq never sent slipped out of it, which caused Diana to question a few things about killing Tariq. She also finds that Marcaith’s dagger is missing.

She rounds up the elves that are in Dawnwind Keep to figure out who took it. One of them was missing. She summoned a wolf and tracked the elf through the tunnel underneath the castle through the dungeon. She almost caught up to him as the gate stone he held glowed in his hand. She was able to kill him just as his body teleported away with the dagger of Marcaith.

Diana assassinated Yamesin, the man who was cheating with Reggie’s wife. While at Staderia, she ran into Derek who told her of how Galathia took control of Carelia.

Leysa was able to finish her rewrite of her smutty book in a couple of weeks and gave it to a priestess of Signosia in the temple library in Staderia to publish. She tried to give it to the temple library of Sovenia, but it was a bit unchaste for the priestess’ liking.

During the 92 days before the Staderian Ball, the party through a birthday party for Diana and for Osian. Osian and Leysa began to date. Katerina convinced Einar to go on a date with her after getting drunk and proposing to Einar. Everyone, including Leysa’s elephant Jane, helped to repair Thornhall and rebuild Dawnwind during this time.

Leysa visited the Temple of Aeontas to gather more information about Diana and received minimal help. Einar replaced all her broken weapons from the fight in Dawnwind Keep. Katerina gambled in Staderia.

Diana opened the Book of the Vile Ones to figure out how to kill a dragon, which the book had minimal information on. She also wanted to learn more about her father’s quest and the Vile Ones. Diana also researched her father’s journal for information, but he left this journal behind when he went on his final quest. She also trains to gain proficiency in firing her pepperbox.

Aladus stayed in Staderia to gather information and sow rumors. He was able to get the general populace to have negative opinions on King and Queen Milas, which was fairly easy to do, while also gaining positive reputation for Leysa, the Orphan Queen.

Diana planned with the undercity of Staderia to take Staderia and put Leysa on the throne, which included the following gangs and people: The Nightstalker Gang led by Kamari Silverton, a druid/rogue drow. She is an ally to the Lunar Pack and based in the market place. The Horns Gang led by Garred Divion, a rogue tiefling. They do not get along with the Lunar Pack and are found in the South District of Staderia. Finally, the Silent One led by Aramis Snow, a half-elf rogue with an invisibility ring. They are neutral and based in Redford and the West Dock. These gangs agree to help at the ball and go with Diana’s plan to put Leysa on the throne.

The day of the Staderia Ball arrived and the party arrived at the party. Diana wore her invisibility cloak to not be recognized.

While there, they witness a human noble from Kyria named Averal Ludithas draw his sword on King Milas when he called his daughter Exandria, a 9 year-old half-elf, Averal’s “mixing with those wild forest creatures.” Its only a warning and intimidates both the King and Queen.

Diana reveals herself to Averal and warns him to leave. He instead, leaves out the back door to the gardens. Shortly after, the party hears warning bells ring throughout the city and the flapping of large dragon wings. A large creature lands against one of the walls and tears it down, revealing Umbralion. He blasts a cone of fire into the crowded ballroom, killing everyone except the party and a few guards. The King and Queen die in a burning husk.

A horde of undead, including two creatures known as deathlocks, and kobold cultists reveal themselves around the rubble of the ballroom. A single man, shrouded in illusions, steps forward. The party learns that this is Narmok, the necromancer of Morthadius himself. He sees Diana, which causes his illusions to stutter, and banishes her to the Shadowfell. He also seriously injures Aladus. Umbralion attempts to eat Aladus, but is saved by Einar as she flies up and strikes Umbralion. She is knocked prone on top of Katerina and is unable to hold to Aladus as Umbralion eats him. During the battle, Narmok also acquires the Orb of Vizoia when it is dropped.

Narmok and his horde leave Staderia shortly after, having completed their mission. Umbralion follows after them. A map of Pyora is left behind. Diana reappears from the Shadowfell after seeing Morthadius himself soaring in the sky.

Diana finds Princess Adarla in the castle and kills her while invisible.

The party tries to reincarnates Aladus, which fails. They find his severed foot and take it to the Temple of Aeontas, where, after a serious offer from Diana, Aladus returns to life completely naked.
