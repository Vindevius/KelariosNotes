### The Underdark

Lvl: 14-16

The party moved through the Underdark, eventually coming across a lava river. They encountered spider-like creatures known as kruthik. Einar through a javelin into the head of the adult kruthik, pinning it to the stone wall. The younger kruthik burrowed away. After a rumbling, a hive lord kruthik appeared and battled the party. They were able to defeat it and all but one of the young kruthik.

They continued forward, coming across Jacko, the same dust mephit that Katerina scared to death while playing rollies. He hid behind a pillar and the party moved on. The party encountered a mindflayer and a mindflayer arcanist with a few duergar performing some ritual. Katerina shot the arcanist when he tried to put her to sleep on sight. The party were able to defuse the situation and leave. Einar discovered a nice looking longsword nearby and picked it up, bringing it with her.

The party managed to cross the lava flow. Katerina and Leysa flipped over it, while Einar and Aladus fell in, but survived the crossing. The party found an exit, only for a gynosphinx named Massazi to appear and block their path unless they answered three riddles. There are three depictions on the walls, one of a skull and bones, one of a black dagger, and one of the sun.

The gynosphinx asked the following riddles:
- Some try to hide, some try to cheat; but time will show, we always will meet. Try as you might to guess my name.
- Tyrants long for me, and the corrupt seek me; but try as they may, they can never hold me. What is my name?
- No one wants me, yet I come. My opposite is a blessing as I am a curse. I strike like a dagger with no care who is cut. What am I?

After Diana correctly answered the first riddle as death. Massazi planeshifted the party into the Void on a singular platform. Leysa incorrectly guessed the second riddle as Domexius, causing the sphinx to knock her off the platform, sending her falling in the infinite abyss. Einar then answered the riddle, first by saying power, which caused the sphinx to knock her off the platform as well, much to Katerinaâ€™s horror. Before the sphinx hit her off, she did answer the riddle correctly by saying dominion.

Einar was left free falling unconscious through the void, close to death. The final riddle, Katerina incorrectly answered death. She was almost knocked off the platform, but climbed back up with help from Diana. Diana had Katerina answer the correct answer of affliction after realizing the riddles were about the three Vile Ones and their associated domains.

Massazi planeshifts everyone back to the cavern. Einar falls limply to the ground as Katerina cries over her unconscious body. Leysa gives Einar a potion of greater healing and Einar wakes up to Katerina crying over her.

Massazi reveals that she is one of two sphinxes. Her mate, Eradas, lives in Kyria. They each guard forbidden secrets, but allow the group to pass by to gain a gift. In the next room, Diana, Katerina, Leysa, and Gurgi see Exsoria, while Einar and Aladus do not perceive her. Exsoria gives a dagger to Diana, her champion, that can be used to destroy the Staff of Morthadius.

The party leaves the Underdark and travels through a tree to New Aurelia, which is partially burnt from dragon fire. Diana and Aladus continue heading north after a disagreement with the rest of the party, who travels into the city. Inside the city, they find Captain Valorum, who is almost dead. Leysa brings him back from the brink of death. He gathers a knight and 11 guards who accompany them on their journey. They catch up to Diana and Aladus. Diana continues forward with Leysa following her, while the rest of the party and their new entourage camp a few hours north of New Aurelia.
