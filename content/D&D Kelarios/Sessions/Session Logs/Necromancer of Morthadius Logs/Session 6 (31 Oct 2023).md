### Assassin Encounter

Lvl: 9

The party left New Aurelia immediately after exiting Castle Aurelia. They rode toward the refugee camp to confront Kaladin. On the path, they were ambushed by an assassin who stabbed Einar in the back. After a brief fight, Diana recognized her as Princess Adarla Milas of Staderia. She seemed to be trying to avenge her brother’s murder. Diana turned into her wolf form.

Diana sees a memory of her father, Vaserius, with his party of adventurers, fighting a group of undead in a dwarven town. Before the party could kill her, she vanished. Diana could smell that she was nearby, but she could not find Adarla.

As they continued, the night began to set in.

  

### The Hostages

Lvl: 9

A lightning blast strikes through the forest, followed by two fire blasts, one of which is much larger than the other. Diana and Leysa scout out the refugee camp. They see the refugees surrounded by skeletons, thugs, three fire snakes, two large fire elementals, the same necromancer from New Aurelia, and Kaladin. Brom, the friend of Einar’s family, is knelt in front of Kaladin, hand on his side, severely wounded.

Leysa hid in a tent. Diana sets a tent on fire and calls Kaladin ugly. Using the earrings of message, Diana directs the group to move to the other side of the camp to try to free the refugees. Leysa used control flames to knock the nearest fire elemental into the tent Diana set on fire. Two fire snakes attempted to attack Diana, and Leysa used control flame to tie them up and kill them.

Einar and Katerina try to free the refugees, but Kaladin sees them. Brom takes the chance to attack Kaladin. Kaladin swiftly stabbed Brom in the chest. He fell to the ground, clutching a photo. Einar and Katerina then use both of their lightning-breath weapons to attack Kaladin.

An intense battle followed. Kaladin calmly left the battle, trusting in the female necromancer and the fire elementals to take care of the situation. Einar, Katerina, and Aladus focused on one fire elemental, with Gurgi hiding behind a nearby tent. Diana faced the fire elemental Leysa threw into the tent. This fire elemental set Diana on fire.

The other fire elemental set Katerina on fire, although she had fire resistance. Einar used the horn of life to crumble all but one skeleton to dust. Diana summoned five wolves. She saw a memory of her father victorious over the undead in the dwarven town of Verusa near the northern hills. They were sent to the eastward town of Koilada to free that town of undead.

Diana sent three of the wolves to track Kaladin. The other two she sent after the necromancer. The two wolves maul a thug. The necromancer kills three of the refugees with an arcane blast, causing them to wither away.

Leysa destroyed a fire snake and attempted to hide in a tent. A thug saw her go in and attacked her but missed. A couple of thugs began to kill the refugees as they fled. The remaining refugees were able to escape.

Aladus was able to cause a fire elemental to laugh uncontrollably for about five seconds. Einar loses the grip on her mace and burns herself on the fire elemental. While throwing daggers at a fire elemental, one of Diana’s daggers hits Leysa in a nearby tent.

The necromancer used a violet dimension door to teleport a few hundred feet away. Katerina used fear to scare one of the thugs. Her shortsword falls through the fire elemental, which burns her. The fire elemental near Einar and Katerina trips and falls, which they use to their advantage.

The two last wolves charge toward the necromancer. The necromancer casts circle of death, which kills the two remaining wolves and the last thug. It also hits Katerina, Einar, Aladus, and the fire elemental.

Leysa throws water on the fire elemental next to Diana, which does negligible damage. The fire elemental grabs Diana and burns her further. The other fire elemental attacks Einar. Einar doused herself in a nearby well to extinguish the fire. Einar filled her waterskin with fire and doused the fire elemental with it. It did minor damage to it.

Diana threw multiple daggers through the fire elemental next to her. As the music changed, fear overtook the party. Leysa caught a glimpse of a creature with eyes all over its body. It vanished before her eyes. Leysa then extinguished Diana.

Einar caught a brief glimpse of the multi-eyed creature, as did Diana from further away. They had no idea what it was. Einar picked up Brom and moved to escape. Diana falls unconscious due to being on fire.

The necromancer tries to hit Katerina with an arcane blast but misses. Leysa tries to pick up Diana but fails. Katerina heads to the horses, where Einar, Gurgi, and Aladus meet her.

The fire elemental attacks Leysa, but it does nothing. Her phoenix ring glows and it is revealed she is immune to fire. Diana failed two death-saving throws (Nat 1). Leysa sees the multi-eyed creature standing above Diana. The necromancer’s arcane burst hit Gurgi and critically hit Aladus, sending him unconscious.

Leysa healed Diana enough to bring her out of unconsciousness. Katerina stabilized Aladus. Leysa moved to the horses. Einar tried to throw a duergar statuette at the fire elemental and failed. Diana disengaged away from the fire elemental. She tried to shoot the necromancer with her crossbow and failed.

The necromancer fired another arcane blast that caused Einar to drop unconscious off her horse. Leysa doused Diana and Katerina with water. Katerina stabilized Einar. Aladus takes Brom and starts riding away. Einar grabs Katerina and rides away. The necromancer fires an arcane blast that hits Gurgi and Diana. Diana falls unconscious again. As she falls unconscious, she prays to Exsoria. Exsoria appears before her, asking what she wants. Exsoria banishes the fire elemental back to its realm before vanishing. Leysa puts Diana on a horse and takes off after the others. Gurgi follows them out, and they escape.

Leysa heals Diana. Katerina finds a place for them to rest in the middle of the night.

Brom motions for Einar as he struggles to breathe. He tells her that her parents would be so proud of her. He tells Einar to kill Kaladin for him and places a picture in her hands. Brom’s eyes glaze over, and he dies. The picture is of Einar’s parents holding a flute and a lute. On the back, in Brom’s handwriting, is “I figured you didn’t have a picture of them and would want to see your parents again.”

Diana’s three wolves find them and communicate to Diana that Kaladin is headed toward the dragon ruins they saw on their way to the Tomb of Gorlath.

In the morning, Einar and Aladus wake up without having rested. They did not heal during the night and are exhausted (one level of exhaustion).
