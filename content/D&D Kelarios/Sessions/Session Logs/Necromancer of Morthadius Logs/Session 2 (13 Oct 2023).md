### Staderia

Lvl: 4

As the party stood next to the empty dock, they could see Sheriff Hadeon escaping by boat across the lake. Einar contemplated throwing the necromancer’s head at him but figured he was too far away. The party headed to an Alchemist’s shop hidden in the marketplace. While there, they bought various items, including poisons, flasks of alchemist’s fire, potions of healing, and a healer’s kit.

Diana headed to the dancing dragon while the rest of the party headed to the general store so Leysa could buy a backpack. While at the general store, they found out that Kaladin had bought the last sending stones. A knight of Carelia with a phoenix emblem emblazoned on his armor walked into the store and recognized Leysa. He asked where she had been and told her how her parents were worried about her. The knight invited her and her party to a masquerade ball in Carelia in two weeks' time. He then left.

At the dancing dragon, Diana bought two bottles of vodka and asked for any new intel. When the rest of the party arrived, Leysa took a shot of vodka and instantly passed out. Katerina gambled with her new charlatan’s dice and was able to convince those she swindled that she did not cheat.

As the party prepared to leave, Prince Dorian Milas, the heir to the Staderian throne and quite the arrogant prick, walked into the tavern with three of his knights. He stabbed and killed a tavern patron just for sitting in his spot. Jowell the firebrand, the bar’s owner and husband to the barkeep, Sovia, began to yell at Dorian for killing someone in his tavern. Before things could escalate further, Diana lit a shot glass on fire and held it up. She threatened Dorian, who did not back down. Diana then threw the glass at him, which exploded. Two of his knights were killed in the fire, and another one was rendered unconscious.

The party booked it toward the door, Einar carrying an unconscious Leysa. Katerina, however, took a shot at Dorian and wounded him immensely. Seeing how wounded Dorian was through the window, Diana threw a dagger at him, piercing his heart. Katerina dragged his body outside, decapitating him and marking the tavern with his blood. They stole Dorian’s and his three knights’ warhorses and rode out of town. They named the horses: Nightmare, a black stallion, Small Creature, a white with brown spots horse, Sandy, a tan horse, and Shadow, a gray horse.  On the way, Einar dropped the necromancer’s head off at Katerina’s parents’ home, who put it on the shelf.

### Thornhall

Lvl: 4 (59:35)

Diana led them to Thornhall, the now capital of the Shiye Tribe since their former capital, Dawnwind, was left in ruins. As they entered, they hefted the head of Dorian in the air to cheers from the residents of Thornhall. They stopped at the healing tent, where Neomi, Diana’s mother, worked. Neomi gave Leysa a concoction that helped wake her up and clear her headache.

Osian Longleaf, Diana’s half-brother, nosily joined them at the tent. Diana gave him a stern talking-to about him being too loud. His falcon is present, and Leysa is infatuated with him. Diana talked to Osian up in their home in the trees. Diana mentioned the ball and her ex-lover, Tariq, who is a vampire. She found six silver arrows and two stakes to potentially use against Tariq. Diana and Osian discussed the war with Staderia. Diana also retrieved a dress for the ball and studded leather armor.

Meanwhile, Einar and Katerina went on a “date” to the tavern. Leysa stayed at the healing tent. Katerina set a drink on fire, which Einar took from her and drank to prevent any stupidity. They spent the night at Thornhall. In the morning, Diana retrieved holy water from the temple of Nafursa in Thornhall. They then leave Thornhall.

  

### Journey to the Tomb

Lvl: 4 (1:18:30)

They arrive in the town of Elarexa, which looks deserted. Einar knocks on a door as the party sees a group of zombies meandering down the street. The party is able to sneak past them into a nearby tavern. Inside, the barkeep describes how, over the last week, the plague came through the town and turned most of the residents into undead. The party realizes that the plague has spread from the northeast. The barkeep had been hiding in the tavern for three days.

After a little debate with Einar, who wanted to take on the town of undead, they stayed the night at the tavern. Diana lined the entryway with table salt. The party uses the orb of Vizoia to hasten their rest so they can continue on their way to the Tomb of Gorlath as they chase Kaladin.

In the morning, they sneak past a couple of zombies out of town.

The party then enters the Wasamar Wilds. Leysa hears the flapping of wings overhead and tells the party. As they listen, they realize it is the wings of a dragon. They hide in the trees. A young red dragon flies above them, scanning the forest. It disappears in the direction they are heading.

They find a set of ruins where the dragon has made its lairs. They find a nearby empty cave and spend the night in the cave. Katerina cast the spell Alarm, and Diana spread salt around the entrance. They continue in the morning to the valley before the Tomb of Gorlath, which is surrounded by the steep walls of the Gorlathia Plateau.

Katerina finds the footprints of a group, including a set of Dragonborn footprints, headed toward the tomb. Einar gets excited to finally face Kaladin, her red Dragonborn nemesis. They stealthily enter into the tomb.

  

### The Tomb of Gorlath

Lvl: 4 (1:38:30-end)

After they descend a staircase into the tomb, Diana was concerned about nonexistent mimics. They came across a group of 4 thugs. After failing to convince them to turn against Kaladin, they killed them after a brief battle. One of the thugs was burnt to a crisp. Leysa snuck to the rooms to the left, avoiding various skeletons and zombies.

The rest of the party followed the main path forward into a room with three dead zombies and a dead thug. Einar led the way, following the stench of a dragonborn. The party sneaks past a table full of skeletons and reunites in a central corridor. Leysa deviates from the path and sneaks past a few rooms of sarcophagi. The main party passes by a locked door and meets up with Leysa in a room with a green brazier with the symbol of two hands holding a heart etched into it. Connected to the room is a glowing green archway. Leysa and Katerina put their hands into the fire, causing Katerina to vanish and Leysa to glow. Gurgi and Diana both in turn vanish in the flames. Einar walks through the archway unharmed. When Leysa walks through the archway, Katerina, Diana, and Gurig reappear. Diana’s wolf amulet and Leysa’s phoenix ring each glow for a brief moment.

The group killed 2 skeletons that woke up to their approach and then glanced into the next room. Kaladin and two thugs were debating between two doors to continue into the tomb. One had three ghouls and a ghast in it, the other four ghouls. The party waited for them to choose. They chose the latter door on the right and fought the four ghouls. One of the thugs died to the ghouls.

Einar chucked a Javelin at Kaladin, and a fight began. Einar used her lightning breath to strike Kaladin, and Leysa ensnared Kaladin in vines. Kaladin used his echo to escape the vines, and Katerina took him down to one hit point. Kaladin begged them to stop as his form changed into the pale visage of a changeling. He admitted his name was Aladus and pledged his service to the party. Aladus told them that he served Kaladin for the money and didn’t care for their methods of necromancy. He mentioned their leader, Narmok, but didn’t know much about him besides that he was an elf.

Einar was furious and became drunk on a shot of vodka Diana gave her. For the remainder of the tomb, she did nothing but blabber. Katerina was by her side the whole time. Diana and Leysa found three rooms with a sarcophagus in each. In the final room, they found the tomb of Gorlath himself, who carried a horn in his arms. Leysa failed to steal the horn, which caused Gorlath to wake as a wight and attack. After a long battle, the two of them were able to defeat him as Einar and Katerina cheered them on from the hallway.

They retrieved the Horn of Life from the corpse of Gorlath and gave it to Einar. This horn enables the wielder to have resistance to necrotic damage and have +2 to Constitution. Undead creatures must make a DC 17 Con Save whenever the horn is sounded. On a success, the undead take 2d6 radiant damage. On a failure, the undead crumble to dust. The horn has 3 charges, which are regained after a long rest.

On the way out, they looted the treasure room. Katerina found the Ring of the Chromatic Dragon. This ring appears to be the body of a dragon with its tail curling around the finger. A milky white stone is affixed to its forehead, which changes color whenever the ring is used. When wearing the Ring, the user may once per long rest as an action, change the color of their scales to that of any one chromatic dragon. When they do so, they change their resistance/immunity to that of the chosen color and breath weapon. If a non-Dragonborn humanoid puts on the ring, which Katerina is, something else happens first.

When Katerina put on the ring, she had to roll a Constitution saving throw, which she succeeded. If she had not, the ring would have done psychic damage and flung off her finger. Katerina grew a foot and turned into a bronze Dragonborn like Einar, which Einar, who was now sober, found very attractive. Her strength score increased by 2, and her charisma score increased by 1.

Katerina failed an Intelligence saving throw and flew into a rage, but Einar was able to talk her out of it. Her rage did awake a flaming skeleton, which the party easily took care of. Afterward, the party easily snuck through the tomb and spent the night in a nearby cave.

  

### Bandit Camp

Lvl:4-5

On their way to New Aurelia to stop whatever has control over the town, the party found a bandit camp in a cave. They sneak attacked the two guards outside, killing one of them, but the survivor was able to limp inside. As Diana shot him in the back, he fell at the feet of two more bandits. An explosion shook the cavern as the entrance caved in.

The party quickly dispatched the remaining bandits in the cavern. Leysa charmed the bandit captain, who showed them to the treasure room and warned of the bear trap outside it, which Diana had already found. Diana spent a while picking the lock, even when the charmed bandit captain offered her the key.

Inside, they found 4 black velvet masks stitched with silver thread, a carved bone statuette of a Duergar, a driftglobe, a +1 shortsword, a bag of holding, a potion of healing, and various other items. Katerina found the Amulet of the Stag, which does the following: This amulet has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. The wearer gains +2 to Constitution Score & AC. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells:

Animal friendship (save DC 13)

Fear (save DC 13), targeting only beasts that have an Intelligence of 3 or lower

Speak with animals

The party left the treasure room and ended the session, looking at a locked door leading further into the cave system. Their only goal is to escape from the cave.
