### The Masquerade Ball

Lvl: 8

The day of the masquerade ball arrived. Diana snuck down into Killden as Katerina gambled at Xanaphia’s Meadery. Diana talked to one-eyed Derek about the plan, and he assured her it would work and to not worry about it. She also learned that Helios has been staying in the castle since the bounty was placed on his head. The party hid their horses near the secret exit to the castle and Gurgi stayed with the horses. Aladus snuck into the castle to report back where each of the guards and knights were stationed in the ballroom.

They prepared for the masquerade. Einar and Katerina were swooning over each other in their dresses. They then arrived at the masquerade as the sun began to set. Inside were various nobles dancing with servants serving them. Guards were at each of the entrances. Einar and Katerina began waltzing on the dance floor.

Leysa and Diana talked with King Arwan and Queen Elowen, who had a knight on either side of them. Diana lied to them about some suitor named George the first from Staderia courting Leysa. They wanted to meet him.

Leysa glanced around the ballroom and saw Helios up on the balcony. The queen sent a guard to lock him back in his room. Leysa joined Einar and Katerina on the dance floor. Diana, meanwhile, kept an eye out for Tariq Williams. As she went to lock Professor Fiddlesticks in his lab, Tariq appeared and asked her to dance. The rest of the party noticed, but didn’t think anything of it.

Tariq charmed Diana and she started having the time of her life. Einar recognized Tariq as the man she owes money to. Einar takes Diana away from Tariq, who walked to the side. Meanwhile, Aladus was making out with a knight in the corner.

Then everything went to hell. An assassin jumped from the balcony in front of the King and Queen and beheaded both of them in one smooth motion. Two other assassins with crossbows at the ready were prepared to fire on the royal family.

The party moved to escape from the castle as Leysa witnessed her parents’ heads fall to the ground. Various thugs and bandits took off their disguises in the midst of the ballroom and brandished various weapons. Tariq, meanwhile, turned into a bat and flew out the patio door. Einar roared, and the crowd parted for them. The party tried to persuade a couple of bandits to let them pass. Einar tried to knock the bandits out but failed to knock them out. Katerina shot them, and the bandits let them pass.

A mage shot a fireball into the ballroom. Diana and Katerina get out of the way and take minimal damage. The others took the force blast of the fireball. The fireball killed a large amount of nobles.

Diana stopped a thug from killing Professor Fiddlesticks. The party with Professor Fiddlesticks made their way past two guards and into the secret exit. The party made their way down the tunnel leading to the river. Diana convinced Leysa that her parents' deaths were her fault for not paying attention during the ball.

As the party left the tunnel to the bank of the river, they found Helios, two cult fanatics of Domexius in golden robes, and two guards waiting for them. During the battle, Helios used a wand of polymorph to turn Einar into a mouse. Einar scampered up Helios’ leg and attacked him. Einar transformed back into herself and burst from Helios’ shirt. The party killed Helios’ entourage, and Diana knocked Helios out.

The party escaped Carelia with Professor Fiddlesticks and an unconscious, tied-up Helios.
