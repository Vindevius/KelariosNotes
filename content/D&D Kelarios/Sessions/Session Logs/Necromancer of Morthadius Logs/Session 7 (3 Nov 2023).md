### The Dragon’s Lair

Lvl: 10

The party gave Einar and Aladus health potions to help heal with their exhaustion. They tied Aladus to a horse, and Katerina held onto Einar as they tried to rest. As they started out, the party that was awake saw two of those same multi-eyed creatures latched onto the sleeping bodies of Aladus and Einar. Those who were awake managed to defeat these creatures, who shifted back and forth from the ethereal plane during the battle. That night, all of them rested without any other creatures appearing.

The following day, the party approached the dragon’s lair in the ruins of Wasamar Wilds. They found Kaladin talking to the young female red dragon, attempting to recruit the dragon. There were five skeletons, a treasure hoard, and a pile of bones in the lair. The following conversation occurred between Kaladin and the dragon:

“If my father didn’t get me to join, why would you think you would be able to, Kaladin?”

“Galathia, you would be in service to the greatwyrm.”

“Morthadius? You intend to free him?”

“Yes. The greatest of our kind. The great shadow, locked away for centuries.”

“You’re insane. You, Narmok, and my father.”

“No, Narmok and Umbralion are visionaries. They see the truth.”

“You want to unleash death itself? Live in eternal shadow?”

“Yes, bring the Shadowfell home to us.”

“You’d have me corrupted by shadow?”

“Only if you desired it. What is it you would want to join us?”

“Give me my own domain. From the southern coast to the Gorlathia Plateau and all the way to the eastern mountains.”

“I cannot promise all of that, but Narmok and Umbralion would. If they agree, you will join us?”

“No, I need to see something more from you.”

The necromancer, named Xarthia, steps out of the shadows and joins them. “Surely a domain of that size would be enough, even for one with such appetite as you.”

“Xarthia, you forget yourself,” Galathia hissed. “Tread carefully in my lair.”

Xarthia walks through the pile of bones. “Or I’ll end up like him? Venodrus? Don’t think I don’t know how you acquired this lair.”

Diana distracted three of the skeletons by turning into her wolf form and leading them into the woods. As Diana morphed, she saw a memory of her father trying to bring back Eria, the halfing bard of Vaserius’ party.

Leysa enters and says, “Hi.”

Kaladin is surprised she is still alive and Xarthia says, “This will be fun.”

Leysa offers Carelia to Galathia. She also offers Aladus to her for two nights of “pleasure.” Kaladin recognizes Aladus, who Kaladin sees as a traitor. Aladus says how he sees the party as his friends now and scolds Kaladin for how he treated him. Galathia offers Kaladin a deal: defeat the party and she will join him, or die and she will accept the party’s offer.

Katerina starts the battle with a missed arrow at Kaladin’s head. Diana loses the skeletons and makes it back as the battle begins. An intense battle begins. Kaladin attacks Aladus and Einar charges, critically hitting Kaladin. Diana takes out the two skeletons remaining and joins the battle. Kaladin uses his extreme fire breath on Einar, Katerina, and Aladus. Aladus viciously mocks Kaladin’s bulbous head.

Xarthia the necromancer brings Venodrus, now a skeletal green dragon, to life, which attacks Einar. Venodrus continuously fails to bite Einar. Xarthia used two arcane blasts at Aladus and Einar. Kaladin summoned the same fire elemental that almost killed Diana directly next to Diana. Diana uses her dust of disappearance and sneaks toward an armored statue. The statue comes to life and attacks her. Katerina makes the fire elemental afraid of her and it runs behind the ruined walls. Leysa summoned ice mephits to help deal with the fire elemental. One of the lost skeletons comes back, which Katerina destroys. Kaladin creates an echo of himself.

Over the course of the battle, Aladus goes down. Gurgi forces munchings and crunchings and Aladus came up just to accidentally stabs himself and goes back down. Leysa immediately brings Aladus back up with cure wounds. Aladus goes unconcious again due to Xarthia’s arcane blast.

Venodrus bites a critical hit on Einar’s arm and is almost taken down. Kaladin attacks Aladus twice, who fails two death saves. Einar accidentally stabs Leysa, who goes down to one knee. Einar then cleaves Kaladin’s head of with the sun blade, killing him. The fire elemental vanishes. Katerina kills Venodrus with an arrow of dragon slaying.

Gurgi brings Aladus back up from unconsciousness. Leysa mass cures wounds. Xarthia downs Einar with an arcane blast as Xarthia also hits herself with an arcane blast meant for Aladus. Diana tears the animated armor apart and throws a dagger at Xarthia.

Diana prays to Exsoria who appears before her. Diana asks for Exsoria to banish Xarthia. Exsoria banishes Xarthia to the fire plane. This confused Galathia and the battle was over. Leysa brought Einar back from the edge of death.

Galathia gives the group gifts for their success and as a trade for Carelia. Diana receives a portable hole. Leysa receives a decanter of endless water. Einar receives 4 beads of force. Katerina receives a potion of gaseous form and a greater restoration spell scroll. The party was also give gold and platinum.

The party left Aladus with Galathia and headed back toward Staderia.
