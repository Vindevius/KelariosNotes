### Dawnwind Keep

Lvl: 11/12

Leysa, after dinner at Dawnwind Keep, took time rewriting a fanfiction she wrote. Sheriff Hadeon walked in and looked at the book, turning straight to chapter 57. Chapter 57 contains explicit material regarding Alejandro, who is based off Leysa’s skewed version of Diana. Sheriff Hadeon remarks at how Leysa isn’t as pure as he thought. Leysa spent the night in the library. In the morning, she continued rewriting the book.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party in Thornhall, sent Natasha, a operative, to find Aladus, who returned without finding him. Horus, Osian’s hawk, was unable to find him too. The party planned to infiltrate Dawnwind and take it back with the help of the Shiye Tribe Council. The party had +5 strength due to being on their period.

Diana fights the urge to go to Dawnwind before sunset due to Tariq’s charming. She also finds her black widow dress for the infiltration of the ruins of Dawnwind. She prays to Exsoria, who appears, physically, before her. Diana discusses the Book of the Vile Ones. Diana is now Exsoria’s champion and a warlock because of this. Exsoria also releases Diana from Tariq’s charming.

Diana opens the Book of the Vile Ones. Her corruption increases as she opens the book and she is stunned for a short time. She learns more knowledge about the history of Kelarios and an ancient battle with the abominations of the world created by Morthadius, Marcaith, and Domexius. It describes the banishment of these three gods, known as the Vile Ones into different planes of existence.

Meanwhile, Aladus walks into Dawnwind Keep with his arm around a vampire spawn. Leysa sees Aladus walk in and go to a room with the vampire spawn.

At sunset, Diana, Einar, Katerina, and the Lunar Pack lay siege to Dawnwind Keep. Diana howls. She sees Vaserius at Koilada fighting a hoard of undead. Five wolves come to her side. She also throws three dire wolves out of her bag of tricks. Katerina gives Gurgi her bag of holding to sneak into the treasury and steal everything inside. Katerina kills a deer, which Diana uses the blood to cover her scent and her arms to her elbows are covered in blood.

Diana heads to the main gate, where she encounters two guards on the wall. Two elves assassinate them with their bows as Diana and her wolves enter the ruins of Dawnwind. She passes by the Temple of Nafursa and the burnt down remains of an orphanage that Sheriff Hadeon burnt down. She approaches the keep itself.

Katerina and Einar each leads a group to either side of the keep. Khetra and Osian approach the keep from behind. Einar yeets Gurgi onto the wall toward a guard. Gurgi flips and lands on the wall. Gurgi attacks the guard and claws out of his eyes. Einar fails to climb the wall and chooses to use her wings of flying to fly over. Katerina climbs up to the window, not waiting for Diana’s signal.

Diana hops off of Nightmare, her horse, and approaches the keep. The guards stop her and nocks an arrow, not allowing her to bring the wolves. Diana uses eldritch blast to kill both of the guards. She then enters the keep and meets two guards and a vampire spawn in the entryway. The vampire spawn brings Tariq into the entryway. Diana tries to convince Tariq to release Leysa and leave Dawnwind, but he would love more bloodshed.

Sheriff Hadeon brings Leysa to the entryway. Diana shows evidence of Sheriff Hadeon burning the orphanage. This caused Tariq to try and charm Leysa, but it fails. Leysa tries to slap Tariq, but he catches her hand and bites Leysa’s neck. Diana cast ice knife on Tariq, which also effects Leysa. The dire wolves then howled.

Katerina had already broken in to the keep and taken care of the shocked guard on the other side of the window. The mage, Dressen, who is married to Natasha, flies up and drops a rope down for everyone else. Gurgi breaks into the treasure room, and Einar and her group breaks into the library, where a group of cultists are.

Einar had a series of unfortunate mishaps. She accidentally threw her sunblade into a door. She was then able to kill one of the cultists in the room. She then threw her mace through the door the sunblade was embedded into. Einar’s morningstar broke, sending the spiked ball into the next room. One of her handaxes also broke.

The battle converges in the great hall, while Katerina snuck through Tariq’s room, leaving two confused vampire spawn behind her. A guard tries to stop her entering the throne room, but she uses darkness to get past them. In the throne room, a necromancer, a cult fanatic, and five skeletons are attacking Khetra, Osian, and their group that broke into the throne room.

After a brief battle, Katerina and Osian defeat the necromancer. Khetra fell during the battle, but was stabilized by Osian using the Orb of Vizoia, that Katerina gave to Osian. Katerina head toward the treasure room.

Diana and Leysa have a challenging battle, during which, Tariq bites Leysa, dropping her to the ground. Aladus is charmed into fighting on Tariq’s side, and kills one of the elves. Einar uses her lightning breath to destroy a row of skeletons and hit Sheriff Hadeon. She also chucks a javelin that sticks into Sheriff Hadeon, who breaks the javelin. Einar uses the horn of life, which bursts one of the vampire spawns into flame. She then slashes Sheriff Hadeon with the sunblade twice. Sheriff Hadeon takes out his gun and fires it over Einar’s shoulder.

Diana hits Tariq with an eldritch blast. As Leysa’s last breath leaves her and her eyes go dark, Leysa bursts in a ring of fire, leaving behind a pile of ashes.

Katerina attempts to unlock the treasure room, but fails. Then fails again, and again, and again.

Einar has a critical hit against Sheriff Hadeon’s stomach with the sunblade. Tariq claws Osian, who drops to the ground unconscious. Diana throws a dagger that cuts Tariq’s ear off. The ashes of Leysa then swirl, out of which Leysa reappears, fully restored to life by the power of her phoenix ring.

Leysa heals Osian, bringing him back from death. Khetra joined the battle. Aladus saw the dire wolf and just walked away, not wanting to deal with that problem, leaving the vampire spawn to deal with it. Leysa casts daylight with the driftglobe, damaging both Tariq and the vampire spawn.

Sheriff Hadeon’s musket misfired and exploded in his hands, leaving him with just his pepperbox. Diana stabs Tariq where his heart would be. “You kind of messed up when you tried to kill my brother.” She then took her dagger and pulled it down his ribcage, breaking every rib along the way. With his last breath, he says, “Believe it or not, I did love you.”

Tariq burst into mist and the daylight spell burns the mist away. The vampire spawn is destroyed shortly after.

Katerina fails to open the door again, looks down at a fallen skeleton, and sees the key, which she uses to unlock the door.

Sheriff Hadeon shoots Einar in the shoulder. Diana then uses her longsword to stab Sheriff Hadeon. He grins, grabs Diana and laughs. He says, “You don’t know still, you don’t know.” Diana pulls the sword up and into his heart. Diana cuts his head off and his body fell to the ground.

Aladus comes out, remarking that he had such a weird dream. Diana walks into the throne room, drenches the throne in alcohol and lights it on fire. Smoke rises out of the broken stained glass window into the rainy night sky.

The party enters a room with an altar in the room, a black stone goblet on it. The windows have black curtains over them and there is a desk. The stone goblet has bloodred liquid in it connected to the negative plane. The negative plane is where the god Marcaith is contained. Leysa vials the liquid, goes to put it back after Diana tells her too. The vial cracks and the liquid touches Leysa’s hand. Her hand begins to steam. She shakes it off as she hears a dark voice say, “too pure,” in her head.

Diana asks for Exsoria’s help. Exsoria tells her to put it where no one can get it. Diana bottles five vials of this bloodred liquid and puts it in her portable hole. The desk has diamond dust, a dagger with a black marking on it, and notes with references to Marcaith, the negative plane, and an island west of Kyria. Leysa goes to pick up the dagger, and hears a voice pleading with her to pick it up. She resists the voice. Diana splashes holy water on it, but it does nothing but sizzle. They leave the dagger on the desk.

Diana frees seven prisoners in the dungeon. Leysa finds a deck of illusions. Katerina finds a rope of entanglement. Einar finds a ring of feather falling. Diana finds a sentient cloak of invisibility. This cloak once belonged to Dumilus, the rogue in Vaserius’ party, and was created by Vaserius. She names him Cloaky and he is an alcoholic.

Aladus plays a tune and Osian and Leysa dance. Einar and Katerina also dance. Diana sits back and watches. Diana reads part of Vaserius’ journal. Diana sends a wolf to find her dad. The wolf howls outside and Diana excuses herself, washing her hands out in the rain. Cloaky recognizes Vaserius near the Temple of Nafursa. Diana stealthily approaches him as he looks up at the temple.

Vaserius looks at her, with tears in his eyes. He recognizes Diana as the champion of Exsoria. Vaserius recognizes the cloak and tells her his name is Flovius. He says that he is sorry and dimension doors away.

Diana finds her mother’s wedding ring from Vaserius in Tariq’s room. Diana sneaks away. Leysa sees a cloak pass by the corner, and follows Diana out. The rest of the party follows.

  

### Wings in the Night

Diana heads to Thornhall’s cemetery. She visits Vaserius empty grave, leaving the wedding ring on the grave.

Meanwhile, Aladus sings Kiss the Girl from the Little Mermaid as Einar and Katerina are next to each other. Both of them look into each other’s eyes, blushing furiously.

Diana then visits her mentor, Zaren Nightfall’s grave, where she talks to gravestone of who she saw as a father figure in an emotional moment. The party returns to Thornhall where Khetra greets them, revealing that Dressen died in the battle. Diana has them bring his pregnant wife Natasha in, who breaks down at the news of Dressen’s death.

Diana places Sheriff Hadeon’s head on the table of the council room. The party returns to her mom at the healing tent. Her mother recognizes Cloaky as Flovius. She tells the party about plans to take down Staderia in 92 days during a ball. She pleads for Diana to stay and Diana reveals that Exsoria chose Diana as her champion. Leysa realizes the true nature of Diana’s power at this moment as she remembers hearing about the champions in the history of the world (Kelarios).

Diana calls on the binding contact in order to stop Leysa from interfering with Diana’s connection to Exsoria.

Cloaky senses something approaching. Gurgi is nowhere to be seen. Aladus is playing a Whole New World as Einar and Katerina are distracted. Diana and Leysa hear the flapping of large dragon wings. Khetra appears above them in the tree paths.

A roar sounds in the night sky as flames engulf the platform Khetra is standing on. A large, adult red dragon is above the forest. Khetra falls out of the tree, unmoving next to the healing tent. The red dragon flaps its wings, causing a tree to snap and fall to the ground. Cloaky recognizes the dragon as Umbralion, the father of Galathia.

The dragon’s voice booms, “Thornhall, what you have done this night will not be forgotten.” Umbralion begins to fly away until Diana blames herself instead of Thornhall. Umbralion stares at Diana, even though she is invisible. He shoots a burst of flame toward Diana, who is able to mostly dodge a 60 foot cone of fire. Flames spread across Thornhall. Umbralion flies above Thornhall and burns the center area where the council room is. He then flies away into the night.

Leysa checks the body of Khetra and there is no pulse. Diana’s mother and Osian fall before Khetra’s charred corpse. Thornhall bursts into action to put out the fire. Diana reveals to her mother that Vaserius is alive, her previous husband before Khetra. Her mother is in shock after the news in combination with Khetra’s death. Diana says that she is cursed and should leave. “Why else would Exsoria choose me.” Her mother convinces her to stay for three months.

Einar, Katerina, Aladus, and Gurgi try to put out the fires. Diana, Leysa, Osian, and her mother take Khetra’s body to the Temple of Nafursa in Thornhall. As they pass the council room, they see the charred corpses of the other members of the Thornhall council. Diana takes radiant damage when walking into the Temple of Nafursa.

The priestess of Nafursa starts the resurrection ritual, placing Khetra’s body on an altar. Golden light encompasses Khetra and his body floats above the altar. Diana’s mother recites her wedding vows. Osian asks his father to return as he is not ready to lead the family. Diana places a hairpin dagger on the altar and asking for help since the dragon will come back.

After a long pause, Khetra gasps for air as Diana tells him the news of what happened.
