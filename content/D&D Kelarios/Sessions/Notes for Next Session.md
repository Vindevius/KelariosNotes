- Garic only wants to talk. He mentions his spy in the Shadows keeping him up to date. He demands they hand over the Morthadium. He stuns whoever attacks him first and shadow steps away. Before he leaves, he mentions how his spy will be fine using the word "she" or "her" to describe her. His spy is Valencia Kalon. She is a member of the Council of Shadows and a Monk (way of mercy). Garic saying "she" is an attempt to take some pressure off of Diana's suspicions concerning Draynnon.
- Valencia Kalon is just inside the Shadow Keep when the party enters. She asks who was outside and attempts against their passive Insight to deceive them as she exclaims how close he got to the orphans she is over.
- Aladus will immediately cast disintegrate at 8th level at Garic using one of his two powdered nycaloth brain. This brings the save DC up to 24. Garic needs to roll a 20 in order to avoid it. Garic does have advantage on spell saves. I already rolled for this encounter. Garic rolled a Nat 1 and a Nat 2. I will be using the Nat 1 for this instance. The DM gains a hope on an enemy Nat 1 and loses a fear.
- A group of 6 gnolls & 3 hyenas covers Garic's escape. Stealth Checks (pass without trace): gnoll 1: 29, gnoll 2: 22, gnoll pack leader: 26, gnoll shaman: 36, gnoll hunter: 22, gnoll flesh gnawer: 30, hyena 1: 21, hyena 2: 18, hyena 3: 31
	- The party will only see 2 hyenas (1&2) and Garic. The Gnoll Shaman is wild shaped as a giant goat.
	- Kyrus has been tracking the gnolls and arrives shortly after the gnolls attack after a hope is spent.
	- Reggie, Luna, and a shadow assassin have a chance of firing from the windows if a hope is spent. Reggie has a chance of throwing a NaK Vial for the first time.
- Draynnon whispers "nightlock" when entering the Shadow Keep. He needs to beat a sleight of hand check against the others' passive perception. If he rolls an 8 or lower, Diana will notice. Otherwise, she doesn't. Diana can use a hope to roll a perception check, two hopes to add a d6 to the roll.
- Leysa makes wisdom check to overcome fear of snakes, DC 17.
- Next time Gurgi gives Munchings and Crunchings to Leysa, he can do a medicine check to find out that Leysa is pregnant with a DC 10, and a DC 20 to find out Leysa is pregnant with twins.
- Aladus regenerates Derek's eye.
- Banshee shows up at Shadow Keep at some point.
- ### REMEMBER CLOAKY!



- NaK Vial prototype: Roll a d6, on a 2-3 it doesn't break, on a 1 it breaks prematurely.
- Eradas' Lair
	- As they enter the catacombs, the main party is cut off from those they bring with them. Only player characters get past. Eradas only lets those he deems worthy to go through the trials in.
	- Three Riddles
		- A cluster of spikes I send to any who call me foe. In the air I stay, for those that draw my woe. (Manticore)
		- My appetite knows no bounds, as I feast upon flesh. Beware my renewal, as I regrow afresh. There are but two ways to destroy my flesh. (Dire Troll)
		- Alone I stay ever watchful, as I look for enemy designs. I collect my trophies near me, they are your warning signs. (Beholder)
	- After the players pass through these trials, Eradas rewards them with a Heroes' Feast as long as they didn't run from any of the trials. If they ran from any of the trials, he shouts, "You ran!" and then roars. He then attacks them for one last trial, whether or not they ran.
	- Eradas' Last Riddle/Puzzle together
		- In what is your strength?
			- Air (T,O)
				- The letters are heard in the wind. If the player isn't secured, the player begins to rapidly be pushed away 30 feet per round. Strength check (DC 15) to pull themselves back on a rope.
			- Earth (G,E)
				- The letters are buried in sand, which is behind a loose wall of stone. DC 15 Investigation check to feel the letters, DC 15 Intelligence check to understand the letters. 1d10 bludgeoning damage per round in the stone & sand.
			- Fire (T,H,)
				- The letters are in the base of the flames. 1d10 fire damage per round in the flames and set on fire.
			- Water (E,R)
				- The letters are written at the bottom of the well. DC 15 Strength check to pull yourself out on a rope. DC 20 Strength check to swim back without a rope. 1d10 cold damage per round submerged.
- Balor, after he is defeated again, becomes a Balor (demon type) in the Abyss. If he dies before the party gets to the Abyss to find Marcaith's poison, they will find him there as a Balor.
- Carceri is difficult to get out of. You cannot plane shift or teleport out of Carceri.
- The Shadow Keep and Leysa's Room in Castle Staderia are protected by the forbiddance spell. The password: nightlock. Diana and the Cleric (Felix of the Woods) are the only ones to know the password. Felix is the equivalent of Diana's Uncle. Balor found it out before possessing Draynnon. This was done by torturing Felix of the Woods and the use of the spell *Suggestion*. Balor, through Draynnon, cut the shadow tattoo of of Felix, taking away his ability to send for help.
- Philip the archmage asked Zayn Shadowend for a Abyssal tuning fork. Zayn saw through Philip's deception and attack him. Philip was brought down to 1 hp and almost escaped after casting time stop and creating a wall of force behind him. Zayn, however, dimension doored past the wall and commanded a cultist to knock him out, which the cultist did. Philip was tortured by Zayn, and after a day of torture (2 Nat 1's) he broke, telling Zayn the party's plan to go to the Abyss and Carceri. Zayn then locked Philip away, contemplating killing him. Instead Zayn left Philip with a nasty scar across his face and cut off Philip's right foot.
- Tunnel system in Staderia (sewers) regular tunnels can be accessed using a shadow tattoo. The shadow keep can only be accessed by the shadow council, be with one of them, or have their permission. Castle Staderia can only be accessed by Diana, Derek, Luna, Leysa, and Osian, or someone with them or their permission.
