- Garic only wants to talk. He mentions his spy in the Shadows keeping him up to date. He demands they hand over the Morthadium. He stuns whoever attacks him first and shadow steps away. Before he leaves, he mentions how his spy will be fine using the word "she" or "her" to describe her. His spy is Valencia Kalon. She is a member of the Council of Shadows and a Monk (way of mercy). Garic saying "she" is an attempt to take some pressure off of Diana's suspicions concerning Draynnon.
- Valencia Kalon is just inside the Shadow Keep when the party enters. She asks who was outside and attempts against their passive Insight to deceive them as she exclaims how close he got to the orphans she is over.
- Aladus will immediately cast disintegrate at 8th level at Garic using one of his two powdered nycaloth brain. This brings the save DC up to 24. Garic needs to roll a 20 in order to avoid it. Garic does have advantage on spell saves. I already rolled for this encounter. Garic rolled a Nat 1 and a Nat 2. I will be using the Nat 1 for this instance. The DM gains a hope on an enemy Nat 1 and loses a fear.
- A group of 6 gnolls & 3 hyenas covers Garic's escape. Stealth Checks (pass without trace): gnoll 1: 29, gnoll 2: 22, gnoll pack leader: 26, gnoll shaman: 36, gnoll hunter: 22, gnoll flesh gnawer: 30, hyena 1: 21, hyena 2: 18, hyena 3: 31
	- The party will only see 2 hyenas (1&2) and Garic. The Gnoll Shaman is wild shaped as a giant goat.
	- Kyrus has been tracking the gnolls and arrives shortly after the gnolls attack after a hope is spent.
	- Reggie, Luna, and a shadow assassin have a chance of firing from the windows if a hope is spent. Reggie has a chance of throwing a NaK Vial for the first time.
- Draynnon whispers "nightlock" when entering the Shadow Keep. He needs to beat a sleight of hand check against the others' passive perception. If he rolls an 8 or lower, Diana will notice. Otherwise, she doesn't. Diana can use a hope to roll a perception check, two hopes to add a d6 to the roll.
- Leysa makes wisdom check to overcome fear of snakes, DC 17.
- Next time Gurgi gives Munchings and Crunchings to Leysa, he can do a medicine check to find out that Leysa is pregnant with a DC 10, and a DC 20 to find out Leysa is pregnant with twins.
- Aladus regenerates Derek's eye.
- Banshee shows up at Shadow Keep at some point.
- ### REMEMBER CLOAKY!



- NaK Vial prototype: Roll a d6, on a 2-3 it doesn't break, on a 1 it breaks prematurely.
- Balor, after he is defeated again, becomes a Balor (demon type) in the Abyss. If he dies before the party gets to the Abyss to find Marcaith's poison, they will find him there as a Balor.
- Carceri is difficult to get out of. You cannot plane shift or teleport out of Carceri.
- The Shadow Keep and Leysa's Room in Castle Staderia are protected by the forbiddance spell. The password: nightlock. Diana and the Cleric (Felix of the Woods) are the only ones to know the password. Felix is the equivalent of Diana's Uncle. Balor found it out before possessing Draynnon. This was done by torturing Felix of the Woods and the use of the spell
- Tunnel system in Staderia (sewers) regular tunnels can be accessed using a shadow tattoo. The shadow keep can only be accessed by the shadow council, be with one of them, or have their permission. Castle Staderia can only be accessed by Diana, Derek, Luna, Leysa, and Osian, or someone with them or their permission.
