- Garic only wants to talk. He mentions his spy in the Shadows keeping him up to date. He demands they hand over the Morthadium. He stuns whoever attacks him first and shadow steps away. Before he leaves, he mentions how his spy will be fine using the word "she" or "her" to describe her. His spy is Valencia Kalon. She is a member of the Council of Shadows and a Monk (way of mercy). Garic saying "she" is an attempt to take some pressure off of Diana's suspicions concerning Draynnon.
- Valencia Kalon is just inside the Shadow Keep when the party enters. She asks who was outside and attempts against their passive Insight to deceive them as she exclaims how close he got to the orphans she is over.
- Aladus will immediately cast disintegrate at 8th level at Garic using one of his two powdered nycaloth brain. This brings the save DC up to 24. Garic needs to roll a 20 in order to avoid it. Garic does have advantage on spell saves. I already rolled for this encounter. Garic rolled a Nat 1 and a Nat 2. I will be using the Nat 1 for this instance. The DM gains a hope on an enemy Nat 1 and loses a fear.
- A group of 6 gnolls & 3 hyenas covers Garic's escape. Stealth Checks (pass without trace): gnoll 1: 29, gnoll 2: 22, gnoll pack leader: 26, gnoll shaman: 36, gnoll hunter: 22, gnoll flesh gnawer: 30, hyena 1: 21, hyena 2: 18, hyena 3: 31
	- The party will only see 2 hyenas (1&2) and Garic. The Gnoll Shaman is wild shaped as a giant goat.
	- Kyrus has been tracking the gnolls and arrives shortly after the gnolls attack after a hope is spent.
	- Reggie, Luna, and a shadow assassin have a chance of firing from the windows if a hope is spent. Reggie has a chance of throwing a NaK Vial for the first time.
- Draynnon whispers "nightlock" when entering the Shadow Keep. He needs to beat a sleight of hand check against the others' passive perception. If he rolls an 8 or lower, Diana will notice. Otherwise, she doesn't. Diana can use a hope to roll a perception check, two hopes to add a d6 to the roll.
- Leysa makes wisdom check to overcome fear of snakes, DC 17.
- Next time Gurgi gives Munchings and Crunchings to Leysa, he can do a medicine check to find out that Leysa is pregnant with a DC 10, and a DC 20 to find out Leysa is pregnant with twins.
- Aladus regenerates Derek's eye.
- Banshee shows up at Shadow Keep at some point.
- ### REMEMBER CLOAKY!



- NaK Vial prototype: Roll a d6, on a 2-3 it doesn't break, on a 1 it breaks prematurely.
- Eradas' Lair
	- As they enter the catacombs, the main party is cut off from those they bring with them. Only player characters get past. Eradas only lets those he deems worthy to go through the trials in.
	- Three Riddles
		- A cluster of spikes I send to any who call me foe. In the air I stay, for those that draw my woe. (Manticore)
		- My appetite knows no bounds, as I feast upon flesh. Beware my renewal, as I regrow afresh. There are but two ways to destroy my flesh. (Dire Troll)
		- Alone I stay ever watchful, as I look for enemy designs. I collect my trophies near me, they are your warning signs. (Beholder)
	- After the players pass through these trials, Eradas rewards them with a Heroes' Feast as long as they didn't run from any of the trials. If they ran from any of the trials, he shouts, "You ran!" and then roars. He then attacks them for one last trial, whether or not they ran.
	- Eradas' Last Riddle/Puzzle together
		- In what is your strength?
			- Air (T,O)
				- The letters are heard in the wind. If the player isn't secured, the player begins to rapidly be pushed away 30 feet per round. Strength check (DC 15) to pull themselves back on a rope.
			- Earth (G,E)
				- The letters are buried in sand, which is behind a loose wall of stone. DC 15 Investigation check to feel the letters, DC 15 Intelligence check to understand the letters. 1d10 bludgeoning damage per round in the stone & sand.
			- Fire (T,H,)
				- The letters are in the base of the flames. 1d10 fire damage per round in the flames and set on fire.
			- Water (E,R)
				- The letters are written at the bottom of the well. DC 15 Strength check to pull yourself out on a rope. DC 20 Strength check to swim back without a rope. 1d10 cold damage per round submerged.
	- The Void Forge
		- Each soul spike is created using 1000 platinum pieces and one divine essence. The soul spike, when finished, is 3 feet long and 2.5 inches at its widest.
		- Eradus blesses one player with the knowledge of creating the spiral soul spike by superheating the platinum and mix in the material and then using that player's strength to craft the spike. Eradus blesses another player for intelligence checks to place divine runes on the soul spike that will rip the soul from the deity's body.
		- It takes a strength check of 21 over the course of three checks to be at full strength in conjunction with an intelligence check of 21 over 3 checks. The strength of the soul spike is based on how close to the DC the check is. If the check was from 16-20, if it misses the target by more than 15, it breaks, causing a -5 to any further attempts to embed it into the deity. 11-15: miss by more than 10. 10 or below: miss by more than 5.
		- The Intelligence check, if 16-20, the DC to hit goes up by 1. 11-15: DC +3, 10 or below: DC +5.
		- Soul Spike Stats:
			- This twisting, javelin-like spike of glittering platinum is covered from tip to base in intricate runes that pulse with divine energy.
			- This soul spike can be thrown or thrust into a foe (an improvised weapon attack using Strength or Dexterity, attacker's choice) at a range of 20/40. Upon a hit, if the target has taken enough damage to leave an open wound, the soul spike may embed itself within the weakened opening.
- Balor, after he is defeated again, becomes a Balor (demon type) in the Abyss. If he dies before the party gets to the Abyss to find Marcaith's poison, they will find him there as a Balor. There is an ambush here by Garic.
- Carceri is difficult to get out of. You cannot plane shift or teleport out of Carceri. There is also a white mass somewhere, which is the beginning of a false hydra.
- The Shadow Keep and Leysa's Room in Castle Staderia are protected by the forbiddance spell. The password: nightlock. Diana and the Cleric (Felix of the Woods) are the only ones to know the password. Felix is the equivalent of Diana's Uncle. Balor found it out before possessing Draynnon. This was done by torturing Felix of the Woods and the use of the spell *Suggestion*. Balor, through Draynnon, cut the shadow tattoo of of Felix, taking away his ability to send for help.
- Philip the archmage asked Zayn Shadowend for a Abyssal tuning fork. Zayn saw through Philip's deception and attack him. Philip was brought down to 1 hp and almost escaped after casting time stop and creating a wall of force behind him. Zayn, however, dimension doored past the wall and commanded a cultist to knock him out, which the cultist did. Philip was tortured by Zayn, and after a day of torture (2 Nat 1's) he broke, telling Zayn the party's plan to go to the Abyss and Carceri. Zayn then locked Philip away, contemplating killing him. Instead Zayn left Philip with a nasty scar across his face and cut off Philip's right foot.
- Tunnel system in Staderia (sewers) regular tunnels can be accessed using a shadow tattoo. The shadow keep can only be accessed by the shadow council, be with one of them, or have their permission. Castle Staderia can only be accessed by Diana, Derek, Luna, Leysa, and Osian, or someone with them or their permission.

	- Damage: 2d8
	- Damage Type:  Piercing
	- Weight: 7lb.

	- When you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 7 damage of the weapon’s type.
Leysa's questions to Verithinus. DC 15 for Verithinus to talk, DC 18 for him to appear.
- What will your daughter be like and what will she be destined for?
	- Why would I spoil that? Your daughters will be a joy in your life, but as with all children, they will bring you some sorrow along the way.
- Who is going to replace the three vile ones?
	- Why would I spoil that surprise? OR (Nat 20) The Raven Queen, daughter of Exsoria and Vecmetus will replace Morthadius. 
- Anything to help moving forward?
	- Be careful. Especially since you carry something so precious. Be watchful. 
- How can I be a better ruler for my people?
	- Be just, but loving. Never be cruel, but be firm. It is a challenge that you will learn as you go.
- Why do you not get involved? DC 20
	- Long ago, I put limits to my powers so I could not take away the agency and free will of anyone. I was once a man. I stumbled upon a source of endless power and created a world far away from here where people could be free to make their dreams a reality. One evil man took a portion of that power, and became a tyrant over those people for a millennia. I lost the love of my life in the aftermath. This was before I took on the full power that I have now.
	- One day, a mere boy came into that world and brought hope with him. Once that tyrant was overthrown, I took the power of that well into myself, and with it I created my children. After that, I put limits to my power as to not become like that tyrant before. I cannot interfere because I have taken that ability away.
- What are your plans after everything goes down? DC 18
	- The gods will leave the material plane. I will place a barrier so none of them can directly interact with Kelarios. We will watch from afar. No longer will you have to worry about rogue deities.
- Why did you choose to reveal yourself to Diana first, when she didn’t believe in you?
	- That is precisely why I did. You are already faithful and believing. Diana tends to have to see things first. Each child is unique and requires a different approach. You did not need to see me to follow me. Diana did.
- How can I be the best mother to my daughter?
	- I believe you are too concerned about your own capabilities. The advice I will give you is to listen to your children.
- Is Helios in Hell?
	- Helios is locked away. A prisoner in Carceri. So, yes. He is in Hell.
- Why did Leysa's parents love Helios more than her?
	- Sweet child, where did you get that idea? Your parents were imperfect, but they loved you immensely. In their old age, Helios manipulated them in his desire for the throne and power. That was his undoing.
- Was it hard to banish the vile ones because you still love them?
	- Yes. Even now, sending you to rip their souls apart with those soul spikes, breaks my heart. Although it is necessary, does not make it easy.
- If I could go back, is there anything I could’ve changed?
	- Of course there is, but you do not have that luxury. Nor do I.
- Are my loved ones at peace?
	- Yes. Your parents are at peace in Elysium.
- Is there anything I need to stop doing?
	- Stop doubting yourself. There are good things to come in the future.
- How do I help Diana?
	- Watch her. Keep those she loves safe to the best of your ability.


When a Vile One dies.
	His eyes look to the distance. With his final breath you hear him say "Father." He falls to the ground as a shadowy mist rises from him. His scales turn to dust, drifting into the air, leaving behind his skeleton. The three soul spikes blink out of existence, as though someone is plucking them from his body. The shadowy mist around him, drifts over the portal as a feminine figure cloaked in dark steps from the Shadowfell. Raven hair drifts around her face, which is covered in an ivory-white porcelain mask. She is draped in a robe of raven feathers. The shadowy mist creates a momentary vortex around her and then condenses into her.

- Saint Tahiti's, "It's a magical place" nursing home.
- Tirian Adrian Ravensilence (Oath of Devotion Paladin) and his bloodhound Brutus confront Diana in the morning. He is her uncle and Orion's son.
- Thingamabobs - store run by Varian Darwin Ravensilence & his artificer husband. They have adopted tiefling twins (Jessica & Jermey).
