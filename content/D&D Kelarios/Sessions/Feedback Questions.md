# Introduction

Welcome! This is a document that will help you in asking for feedback from your fellow players and GMs. It’s divided in two sections: For GMs and For Players. If you’re a GM, you can use the questions listed in the For GMs section and send them to your players. If you’re a player, you can use the question listed in the For Players section.

Feedback can be tough to receive. Many of us read feedback as a personal attack, even if we do so unconsciously. To not take it as such, the best way is to expose ourselves to feedback given by people we love and trust and who love and trust us back. You are more than encouraged to ask for specific ways to be given feedback to make it easier to receive it. For example, you may ask someone to not give you feedback on a specific part of the session you were not ready for, or on an area of playing/GMing you don’t feel ready to receive feedback on. However, check in with yourself often to see when you are ready to receive feedback in those areas, as that’s what will lead you to improve on them faster.

# I: For GMs

These are questions that a GM can ask their players to receive feedback. You do not have to ask every single one of these questions, or ask these questions every session if you do not want to. Tailor the questions you ask based on what has happened or will happen in your campaign.

Questions:

- What was your favorite part of the session?
- What was your least favorite part of the session?
- How did you feel about combat this session? Did it feel too slow? Too easy?
- How did you feel about roleplay this session? Did you feel you had enough time dedicated to it?
- How do you feel about the campaign in general? Does it feel like it’s moving at a good pace? Do you have any concerns about the campaign?
- What are your hopes for the next session?
- Anything else you’d like to talk about or mention?

# II: For Players

These are questions that a player can ask other players or their GM to receive feedback. You do not have to ask every single one of these questions, or ask these questions every session, especially as a player. A good rule of thumb would be to request feedback once a month, or after a particularly intense moment in the story you are all telling at the table.

Questions:

- Do you have any (positive or negative) notes on how I handled combat? Did you feel like I took meaningful actions during combat?
- Do you have any notes on how I’m roleplaying my character?
- Do you feel like you have a good handle of who my character is and where I’m going with them? Do they feel like an actual person?
- How do you feel about the dynamic between our characters/the party? Is there anything you’d like to change or explore?
- Is there anything you think I could improve on, be it combat or roleplay?
- Anything else you’d like to talk about or mention?
