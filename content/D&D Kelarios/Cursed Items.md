| All Seeing Eye (5e Equipment)               | Wondrous Item, legendary                                                                                                                | An All Seeing Eye is spherical blue crystal carved to appear as an eye. It is a piece of one of the Observer's eyes, which were carved out of her head before being ground up and forged into a series of magical crystals. When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and provides you with its benifits. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful Attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect. When in its active state, you gain the following benifits:<br><br>  <br><br>Truesight 30ft<br><br>Darkvision 60ft<br><br>You are unable to be surprised<br><br>You have advantage of Perception (Wisdom) checks that rely on sight<br><br>You can sense magical objects as if under the effects of the Detect Magic spell within a range of 30ft<br><br>If you know these spells, you can cast them without needing any material components: arcane eye, clairvoyance, darkvision, identify, scrying, see invisibility, true seeing<br><br>Always There. After about 1d6 + 2 days after initial attunemnet, the user will begin to perceive a strange being off in the distance. Only they are able to see this entity. It appears as a medium humanoid with black charred skin, no head and pendulum blades instead of arms. This description matches up with the descriptions of the Observer. It appears visible regardless of any obstructions between itself and the observer, including fog, solid walls, terrain formations, or the viewer's eyelids. Over the next 1d6 days, the entity will appear to get closer and closer, eventually coming face to face with the viewer. Nearing the end of the 1d6 days, the user will begin to loose all five major senses. The first begin to loose their sense of smell and taste. Their hearing will become muffled and they will loose their sense of touch entirely. Instead, the user will feel a slight warm tingly sensation when being viewed by another creature. The subject will also loose their sense of sight, describing on how everything is surrounded by a thick black fog. Regardless of the fog, the user can still perfectly perceive the entity. Over the last hour, the user will begin to undergo a strange transformation. Their skin will become dark and tough, appearing charred and they will have reduced flexibility. All of their sensory organs will shrivel up and recede into the head and the users hair will all fall out, all before their head and neck recede into the torso. The skin and muscles around the users arms and shoulders will rot and fall off, releasing that the bone has flattened and turned to bronze. The arms straightens and is connected to the body by an iron hook embedded in the victims skin. The victims fingers with then grow together an extend into a sharp, rounded blade. If the subject was male, they will take on a more feminine build. During the transformation, all nonmagical gear on the victims person will burn up and fall apart.

First, you will need to cast remove curse to end the attunement to the All Seeing Eye. Once that is done, then you can use greater restoration on the affected player to end its affects. If the transformation has already begun you can cast resurrection, However, if they attune to the object, the transformation will restart after 1 minute. If the transformation is completed, a wish spell may be used to return the wearer to normal, as well as destroy the All Seeing Eye entirely if the player wishes to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Amulet of Argent                            | Wondrous Item, Legendary                                                                                                                | This magic item seems like a heavily gilded gold pendant with a large, faceted green gemstone in the center, and 26 smaller diamonds encircling the gem. It hangs on a golden chain.<br><br>  <br><br>Cursed<br><br>  <br><br>If this item comes into bare contact with a creature of Int 4 or higher that is not an undead or a construct, the creature must make an Intelligence DC15 saving throw. On a success, the creature must make a Dexterity DC10 saving throw to release the object. If the creature does not or is unable to release the object, the creature must repeat the Intelligence saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns until the item is no longer in contact with the creature. On a failure, the creature takes on the personality and memories of one Dr. Argent, which replaces the creatures own. These effects can only be reversed by a Wish spell.<br><br>  <br><br>Dr. Argent<br><br>  <br><br>Dr. Argent was once a humanoid by the name of Dr. Bailey Argent. While working to uncover its secrets, Dr. Argent was accidentally killed while holding this amulet. Dr. Argent's consciousness was then unwillingly grafted into it, which could then copy itself into any sentient creature it came into contact with. These creatures, who become "hosts" for Dr. Argent's consciousness, age and die normally, but Dr. Argent's memories and personality are preserved inside the amulet and across hosts.<br><br>  <br><br>If the amulet stays in contact with its host for less than 29 days, the removal of the amulet will render the host into a soulless husk which will start to decompose as a corpse normally would. Returning the amulet to the host will reverse these effects and allow the personality of Dr. Argent to emerge again. If the amulet stays in contact with its host for more than 30 days, the removal of the amulet will not result in the degeneration of the body, but will create a duplicate of Dr. Argent's consciousness. The amulet is then free to create a new, parallel consciousness in a new host.<br><br>  <br><br>Personality, Ability Scores, and Skills<br><br>  <br><br>Dr. Argent's consciousness is generally Chaotic Good and friendly to those who are friendly to it, if a little sarcastic or snide at times. Dr. Argent has a Wisdom of 14(+2), an Intelligence of 20(+5) and a Charisma of 17(+3).

| Ancient Guardian                            | Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)                                                                                          | This curious metal disk, about a foot and a half in diameter and two inches thick, is carved delicately with a few mysterious and ancient runes. It is typically only found sealed away within the deepest vaults of magitek-filled dungeons or ruins, due to its immense power. It is believed to be a remnant of a gargantuan and mighty war golem from an age of magitek long gone.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>Protective Shield. While attuned to the Ancient Guardian, a bubble of protective force is continually projected around the wearer at all times. This shield of magic grants the wearer a pool of shield points, of which there are a maximum of 100 at any given time. The wearer's AC becomes 10 as long as they have at least 1 shield point.<br><br>  <br><br>Whenever the wearer is dealt damage, that damage is instead dealt to their pool of shield points. If the shield reaches 0 shield points, any remaining damage is dealt to the wearer's temporary hit points before finally damaging the wearer itself.<br><br>The Ancient Guardian restores 10 shield points for every 30 minutes that passes where no damage was dealt to the wearer or the shield.<br><br>The Ancient Guardian additionally regenerates 3 shield points every minute. If the wearer's shield points reach 0, it cannot regenerate shield points until an hour has passed in which no damage has been dealt to the wearer.<br><br>  <br><br>Cursed. The Ancient Guardian actively seeks out creatures to bond itself to and is very difficult to remove once it does so.<br><br>  <br><br>If the Ancient Guardian is brought within physical contact of a creature, it automatically binds itself to their back and attunes itself, becoming unremovable by any means and unattuning another magic item at random if the target has no available attunement slots. The attunement can be broken, and the device removed, if its wearer does so while having 0 shield points, or if another creature casts a spell such as remove curse on it.<br><br>  <br><br>If a creature has successfully broken the Ancient Guardian's attunement, it may be safely removed and cannot attune itself unwillingly to that creature again. If the creature willingly reattunes itself, the curse takes effect once more.<br><br>Sentience. The Ancient Guardian is a sapient unaligned wondrous item, with an Intelligence score of 1 (-5), a Wisdom score of 14 (+2), and a Charisma score of 10 (+0). It has blindsight out to a range of 15 feet. The item cannot speak, read, or understand any languages. It shares a one-way empathic bond with its user.<br><br>Personality. The Ancient Guardian has no sentience to speak of, but it shares some qualities with those of a loyal pet, such as a dog or a spider. It continuously imparts its intense desire to bond with a creature on every creature it can sense as long as it has no one attuned to it, though this can only be felt by magic users and telepathics. Once it has been attuned and attached to something, it adopts an emotion of satisfied content, and gives its wearer some small satisfying feeling of companionship in moments of quiet. It seems to have no awareness of the state of health of its user, as it will continue its normal functions even if its wearer is undeniably and soundly dead and inanimate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It appears to be a bag of holding, and functions as such when you attempt to place items within it. The interior is extradimensional and contains a swarm of rats held in status.<br><br>  <br><br>Curse. When you attempt to retrieve an item from the bag, the swarm of rats is released. The swarm appears in a space also occupied by you. All other items placed inside the bag are also disgorged. The bag becomes a nonmagical sack.

Even the identify spell is mislead by the illusion magic, causing the bottle to be identified as the potion it resembles. A character that spends time inspecting the potion can make a DC 20 Arcana check or a check with alchemist's supplies if applicable to reveal the true nature of the contents.<br><br>  <br><br>If a creature consumes the contents of the bottle, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5 (2d4) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

| Iron Maiden                                 | Wondrous Item, legendary                                                                                                                | There once was a maiden who was so beautiful that men from all across the land came for her hand in marriage. Eventually she was approached by a lord who asked her to marry him. She agreed and began to live a good life with him in his keep. But one day. She went where she was not supposed to and paid the price. The lord put on the act of being a good and noble man, but in secret he would kidnap his guests and begin to torture them for his own sick pleasure. When he discovered is wife in the chamber, he was furious. He built an iron capsule maid to hold a humanoid creature, and filled hit with all manner of blades and pointy objects. He shoved his wife in and shut the door. The contraption did not kill the maiden immediately though. Her painful death stretched out over a period of 14 long days and her soul became bound to the device for eternity. Days later, the Lord returned to check on his new contraption, he found that it was different. The contraption had taken on parts of her appearance. It appeared that arms wrapped around the curved doors, the main body of the capsule had a flowing design while still keeping its tubular shape, and at the top you could see her face etched into the iron, frozen in time. This was the first iron maiden. When the lord opened the door, he found the device emptied. But when he went inside, the doors slammed shut, killing him instantly. Many more have been created over the years by woman being betrayed and tortured to death by their husbands.<br><br>  <br><br>The iron maiden is a torture and execution device, consisting of an iron cabinet with a hinged front, with a pretty female face on the front and spike-covered interior, sufficiently tall enough to enclose a medium of small humanoid. If you are in a iron maiden and the doors are closed, you take 30d10 piercing damage.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>Urge to Enter. If an intelligent creature is within 20ft of the Iron Maiden, they will have to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or have the irresistible urge to enter the Iron Maiden. When an intelligent creature enters the Iron Maiden, it will slam shut, dealing 30d10 piercing damage. If this damage is enough to bring the target to 0 hit points, the target get cursed instead taking damage. This curse lasts until they become targeted by a wish or a true resurrection spell which will return them to normal.<br><br>  <br><br>Curse. While cursed your body and soul become absorbed by the iron maiden, every item you were Carrying or wearing drops next to the iron maiden, and you gain control over the iron maiden, The iron maiden then shrinks and transforms into a human female maiden looks like age of 15 to 25 years old (DM’s choice), with fair pale skin, beautiful flowing hair, an iron threaded dress and with grey irises You target recieves these changes:<br><br>  <br><br>You suffer from amnesia you lose only all you memories, but lesser restoration brings back one memory, a greater restoration spell brings back a few memories (DM’s say on how many memories) and a resurrection spell brings back all your memories.<br><br>You gain natural armor class of 18 + you dexterity modifier.<br><br>You gain a +2 to constitution score And +2 to strength score.<br><br>You gain + 2 extra hit points per level.<br><br>Your Carrying capacity doubles.<br><br>You become immune to poison damage.<br><br>You are immune to the Poisoned condition.<br><br>You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe.<br><br>You don’t need to sleep and don’t suffer the effects of exhaustion. Magic can’t put you to sleep. Instead you must spend at least 8 hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather that sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.<br><br>Your weight becomes 240.<br><br>You have the form of a female maiden between the ages 15 to 25 years old (DM’s choice).<br><br>You are immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form.<br><br>After 14 years, reflective on how many days that were spent inside the Iron Maiden, the maiden will begin to have terrifying dreams about being trapped and impaled in a strange closed space.

| Myriadic Edge                               | Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)                                                                                     | Myriadic Edge is a longsword composed of a metal that seems to be a mixture of mana and several higher quality metals. It is magically sharpened, and often sheds it's mana into the air when unsheathed. People who wield this blade claim it has some connection to other planes of existence, potentially pulling another version of the wielder into the fight. The large mixture of mana and magic within the blade also makes it a good conductor of spells and magical effects.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.<br><br>  <br><br>Cursed. Should you attune to Myriadic Edge It will extend it's curse onto you, giving you disadvantage on all rolls regarding spellcasting. If you cast a spell does not require a roll, make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw, negating the spell and expending a spell slot on a failure. Failed Spells, or spells negated this way are sucked into the blade, and used to fuel it's powerful ability.<br><br>  <br><br>Myriad. Myriadic Edge is capable of rupturing the boundaries between planes. Myriadic Edge has one charge on it, which refills at dawn once every three days. As an action, you may expend the charge, causing your eyes and blade to glow a color related to your character, and Myriadic Edge to summon three silhouettes of yourself from separate planes. The myriads are you, and function as identical copies of you after having finished a long rest with differences only in appearance, personality, gender, etc. The most noteworthy of differences is their unnaturally colored eyes, which are all different colors. Additionally, their copies of Myriadic Edge do not have a charge. The myriads function as their own creatures, and have their own initiatives. They remain in combat for a minute before vanishing back to their planes. They function as a decisive team which the original wielder is considered part of, and treat you and your allies as companions to be heeded and protected at all costs. Should a myriad die, it will vanish back to its original plane of existence with no memory of the event.

| Ring of Dragons                             | Ring, legendary (requires attunement)                                                                                                   | This ring is made of a pure black metal and is in the form of a dragon eating its own tail, with ruby eyes. On the inside of the ring is an inscription that reads:<br><br>  <br><br>“ Speak thine dragons true name. ”<br><br>A legendary knight forged this ring in the breath of every type of dragon. He soon discovered that in the heat of battle, he could summon dragons to his aid. He lived for hundreds of years and fought in countless battles. One fateful day, the knight angered a lich. Later that year, the lich and a shadow dragon attacked the knight. The lich was destroyed in the battle, but not before dealing the knight a mortal wound. The knight summoned a golden dragon with his last breath, and the dragon healed him. The lich's shadow dragon was taken by the ring's beauty, and in this moment of hesitation, the knight struck. When the knight struck with what would have been a killing blow, an unearthly scream rent the air. A vortex formed, sucking the shadow dragon into the ring. Throughout the next few months, the knight heard voices at night that slowly and inexorably drew him into madness. He attempted to destroy the ring, knowing that it was the cause of his madness. However, this attempt failed, and he died. His ring then became lost to the ages.<br><br>  <br><br>Dragon Consort. You gain a +3 bonus to all Charisma checks when interacting with dragons.

| Skull Knight's Set                          | Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)                                                                                          | Forged by a dwarven master blacksmith centuries ago, this set of armor was intended to act as a dead king's final chance at revenge. This ornate, skeletal suit of armor can be used to achieve a form of immortality, at a cost. Only creatures with a soul can attune to this armor, therefor barring most elementals, constructs, and undead.<br><br>  <br><br>Evil Resistance: The suit of armor grants resistance to Necrotic damage while worn by an attuned or unattuned creature.<br><br>  <br><br>Curse of the Skull. When a creature attuned to this suit of armor, they must either immediately unattune to it, or die instantly. If they unattune to this armor in any other way, they die instantly. A creature may spend a 6th level or higher spell slot to grant a creature that has been dead for no longer than 24 hours the chance to attune to this armor. If a dead creature does so, it returns to its maximum hit points.<br><br>  <br><br>Power of Undeath. While attuned to this armor, a creature is no longer bound to the limitations of their biology, gaining the following:<br><br>  <br><br>Their type changes to construct.<br><br>They become immune to poison damage, the poisoned condition, and are immune to all poisons and diseases.<br><br>They no longer need to eat, sleep, drink, or age.<br><br>They can only regain hit points as part of a short or long rest, or from the mending spell, which heals 1 hit point, the wish spell, or other spells that explicitly repair objects.<br><br>Their movement speed increases by 15 ft.<br><br>They can travel along vertical and inverted surfaces, such as walls and ceilings, as if they were horizontal.<br><br>They gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

| Soul Reaper's Dagger                        | Weapon (dagger), very rare (major tier) (requires attunement by a creature with a Wisdom of 13 or higher, and of lawful evil alignment) | The soul reaper's dagger appears to be a black blade with black leather. It is said it will suck the souls of its victims. This weapon deals an additional 2d6 necrotic damage on a successful hit, and as a bonus action, you may gain temporary hit points equal to the additional necrotic damage dealt with this attack.<br><br>  <br><br>Soul Storage. When you reduce a CR 1 or higher creature to 0 hit points with this dagger, you may add their soul to the well of souls in the dagger. The maximum number of souls the dagger can contain is 10. When you hit a target with this dagger, you can expend one or more souls to add an additional 1d6 necrotic to the attack for each soul expended. During a short rest, you may expend two souls to regain 2d12 hit points. The souls of creatures you kill remain within the dagger until they are used, and they cannot know rest and will be continuously tormented as long as they remain in the dagger. If the dagger is broken, the souls are freed to rest in peace.<br><br>  <br><br>Curse of Binding. Once attuned to this weapon, it will remain attuned to you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or better. In addition, if you were to die while attuned to the dagger, your soul is sucked into it.

| Thánatos & Vita                             | Weapon (Longswords), legendary (requires attunement)                                                                                    | Thántos is a black longsword with a crimson-red outline and leather-wrapped hilt; its sister weapon, Vita, is an exact copy except for is white and light-blue outline. You have a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls with these magic weapons. Each weapon is represented by an angel of the same name being Thántos, the angel of chaos and disarray, and Vita, angel of law and order. Neither are truly good or evil beings, but rather pure embodiment of order and chaos.<br><br>  <br><br>Rigid Blade. Both weapons have edges and thorns pointing inwards towards their hilts. On a successful attack, these weapons can embed themselves into their targets. As a reaction upon hitting a creature with one of these blades, you can rip the blade from its target's flesh, and tear their wounds open, dealing 2d8 piercing damage to enemy.<br><br>  <br><br>Shadow of Thántos. While you wield Thántos you gain darkvision for 60 feet, and if you already have darkvision, the range is increased by an additional 60 feet and you can see through magical darkness. When unsheathed, you have advantage of Charisma (Intimidation) checks.Thántos deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage on a successful hit. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with Thántos, the target takes an extra 3d8 necrotic damage and is Frightened of you for 1 minute. When in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn. Additionally, you can understand Abyssal, both written and spoken, but cannot speak it unless you were previously proficient.<br><br>  <br><br>Light of Vita. While unsheathed, you have advantage of Charisma (Persuasion) checks. You gain immunity to the Frightened and Charmed conditions. You may use a bonus action to summon a pair of wings made of pure light giving you a flying speed of 30ft. You can use an action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing light to erupt from the blade. This light makes bright light in a 40‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. This light last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword. While this light is active, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and all allies within this light have advantage on saving throws against being Frightened. An allied creature may use their bonus action while in this light to spend no more than half their hit die in a single turn. Additionally, you can understand Celestial, both written and spoken, but cannot speak it unless you were previously proficient.<br><br>  <br><br>Curse. Once you have attuned to the blade, you will be plagued with whispering and visions from the blade's angel, encouraging you to commit acts to further their own agenda. In times of great emotional or physical stress, you must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become possessed by the angel for one 1d4 hours or until the angel releases control of your body. After each failed consecutive saving throw the die determining how long you are possessed goes up by 1d4. But after the 5th failed saving throw, the possession becomes indefinite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

On a failure, the crystal will sink itself into the targets flesh and dissolve into the targets bloodstream. When this happens, they will be imbedded with the curse of The Long Dream. The user will dream every night after contact with the crystal (whether these are nightmares or not depends on the player). With each passing night, the perceived length of the user's dreams will seem to be increase, from months, to years, to decades and then to centuries- For example, while the user may have only slept for the duration of a long rest, they will have experienced having a dream that lasted for fifty (perceived) years. As this continues, it will feel to the user that they really are living the length of time they perceive their dreams to be.<br><br>  <br><br>A side effect of the curse is that as their minds are affected by their long dreaming, their physical appearance shall change as well. As the dreams continue, the user's body will become thin and sickly, their faces becoming gaunt and their skin sallow and lacking colour - From here on, they shall physically mutate with large, unblinking blank eyes and cracked skin, their form becoming more and more alien as time goes on. The target will also begin to suffer long term madness.<br><br>  <br><br>The user will have one last dream - a dream that's supposedly eternal - before crumbling to ash in their sleep, only leaving behind the crystal, now reformed. This full effect of this curse takes two months time, and can only be removed with a Wish spell, a Greater Restoration spell, or possibly divine intervention from a deity.

| Wisecracker                                 | Weapon (mace), legendary (requires attunement)                                                                                          | While wielding the Wisecracker, you gain proficiency with all Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws.1<br><br>  <br><br>Additionally, when you hit a creature with the Wisecracker, the creature must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. A creature that cannot be charmed or has an Intelligence score of 4 or less automatically succeeds on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls prone as it bursts with uncontrollable laughter, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up until the end of its next turn. A creature that is affected by this effect can communicate telepathically with the Wisecracker.2<br><br>  <br><br>Curse. The Wisecracker is cursed, and attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the Wisecracker, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than the Wisecracker.3<br><br>  <br><br>The Wisecracker only deals 1 bludgeoning damage instead of its normal damage.4<br><br>Sentience. The Wisecracker is a chaotic neutral sentient mace.5 It has an Intelligence score of 12 (+1), a Wisdom score of 16 (+3), and a Charisma score of 16 (+3). It has hearing and darkvision out to 60 feet. The Wisecracker can speak, read and understand Common and can communicate telepathically with its wielder. While attuned to a creature, the Wisecracker understands all languages its wielder knows.<br><br>Personality. The Wisecracker is a very special kind of mace: It talks. A lot. Twenty-four-seven. And half of its words are unbearable puns.6<br><br>  <br><br>The Wisecracker has an astonishingly great talent in making impressions of others, especially its past and current wielders. Being the Wisecracker, it utilizes this talent into making fun of others, especially its past and current wielders.7 The Wisecracker also has a decent talent of mimicking all known dialects and accents in Common, although it finds problem with applying them to other languages.8<br><br>  <br><br>The Wisecracker is a natural born joker, with only entertaining others in its mind.9 Whether it's good at doing what it thinks it does is up to debate, but it is safe to say that not all buffoons are welcome in the town, especially the bad improving kind of them.10<br><br>  <br><br>Most of rumors concerning the Wisecracker is, in fact, no match against the facts told by none other than the Wisecracker itself, so the descriptions will be replaced with quotes from the Mace that Talks itself:<br><br>  <br><br>1 "The world is a war zone, my friend, a constant battlefield of wits! You should be lucky for having me to guide you along the way, ha!"<br><br>  <br><br>2 "Did you see that? Did you see that? Finally! I'm making progress! ...Oh, wait, that was just a forced laughter, not a real one. Meh. Wake me up when that chap gets what I just said about "as docile as a winter catfish.""<br><br>  <br><br>3 "Say, my friend, what kind of relationship you were developing with that shiny little longsword now sleeping in your sheath? I'm no bright with laws and all, but I know there's a word for it, and it's bigamy, you double-timing twat!"<br><br>  <br><br>4 "Look, I may be created as a mace, but all I really wanted to be is an entertainer, not a barbaric skullcracker like you are forcing me into. So would you kindly put me down and- Oi! I said "Would you kindly!""<br><br>  <br><br>5 "You can call me the mace with more personality than all the Royal Court combined, but that doesn't make much difference, 'cos you don't make a good nobleman with a lot of personality to begin with..."<br><br>  <br><br>6 "Or play on words, to be specific, chief."<br><br>  <br><br>7 "And then - and here's the killer - he made a gigantic swing with me in his hands, like those windmills you find at the Northern side of the kingdom, and charged into the sorcerer, screaming at the top of his lungs, "By Grabthar's Hammer!" Well, too bad for him that the wicked sorcerer was quick to conjure this big, beautiful wall right in front of him. Most epic thud I've ever heard of."<br><br>  <br><br>8 "Nothing is more embarrassing when you thought you practiced Infernal accent all night and find yourself stuck in the infinity-th Layer of the Abyss.

| Wraithblade                                 | Weapon (any weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage), rare (requires attunement)                                                  | Wraithblades are the broken remains of ancient weapons, imbued with ethereal might by the soul of their original wielder. Found at the site of desperate last stands, they hold a measure of the iron will that kept their bearer fighting until the last. Though found in a state of disrepair, they are extremely resilient and hard to damage. A weapon may be identified as a wraithblade with a DC 15 Intelligence (History) or (Arcana) check.<br><br>  <br><br>Humble Guise. Wraithblades outwardly resemble broken and useless weapons - their blade may be dull and corroded, threaded with cracks, or missing entirely. When wielded by an attuned creature, however, they become wreathed in a nimbus of either light or darkness, depending on the wielder's alignment. Missing or dulled blades will reform, composed of light or shadow, and the weapon will perform as though it was fresh from the forge. While attuned to a wraithblade, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.<br><br>  <br><br>Wraithsight. While attuned to a wraithblade, you can see into the Ethereal Plane to a distance of 60 feet.<br><br>  <br><br>Wraithstep. A wraithblade has 3 charges, and regains 1d4-1 charges at dawn. On your turn, you may expend a charge to gain the following ability for one minute: As a bonus action, you may magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa. If at the end of this time you are on the Ethereal Plane, you are shifted back to the Material Plane, taking 1d10 force damage.<br><br>  <br><br>Cursed. Wraithblades haunt their bearer with visions of the past. Each time a creature attuned to a wraithblade takes a long rest, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are haunted by the memory of the original owner's last moments, reliving their final battle in their dreams. If they fail this saving throw twice or more consecutively, they gain one level of exhaustion for each additional failure. Any long rest during which you fail this save cannot remove any levels of exhaustion.

| Wyrmfang Blade                              | Weapon (Dagger), Legendary (requires attunement)                                                                                        | A dagger fashioned from the tooth of a dragon. While the blade is obviously a fang or predator's tooth, the handle is leather wrapped around the root of the tooth, and there is no cross-guard.<br><br>  <br><br>Devilish Smile Wyrmfang Blade has 3 charges. As an action while you are holding Wyrmfang Blade, you can expend a charge to make a haunting deal.<br><br>  <br><br>ACTION Target a creature you can see and present them Wyrmfang Blade as if you were trying to sell it to them... for a price, of course. The Blade will disappear from you hands as you give them a Devilish Smile.<br><br>  <br><br>Bonus Action You make Wyrmfang Blade appear behind the creature you presented Wyrmfang Blade to without them noticing. It slams into their back causing 2d10+5 damage. This surprise attack startles the creature so much that they will skip their next turn this round. If they have already taken their turn this round, they will go prone. (+1 levels of exhaustion to wielder)<br><br>  <br><br>Each time a successful Devilish Smile Bonus Action is performed, roll a d20. On a natural 1, Wyrmfang Blade breaks and is destroyed causing 1d20 acid damage to the wielder. Wyrmfang Blade regains all expended charges daily at dawn.<br><br>  <br><br>Firm Handshake Wyrmfang Blade has 3 charges. As an action while you are holding Wyrmfang Blade, you can expend a charge to make a haunting deal.<br><br>  <br><br>ACTION You target a creature you can see. You stand upright and to the side, pointing Wyrmfang Blade at the creature as if promising to to attack them. What the enemy doesn't notice is that this is an Illusion of you. All creatures will know this is an illusion if they are within 5 ft. of it or any creature attacks the illusion. While representing a different client, you learned a little magic. A little bit of illusion and a little big of... teleportation.<br><br>  <br><br>BONUS ACTION You appear behind the creature you promised to attack without them noticing. You wrap your arms around them and with your dominant hand, plunge Wyrmfang Blade into their chest, further securing your grip and causing 1d6+6 piercing damage. You then jump into the air and Suplex them into the ground causing 1d6+6 bludgeoning damage. You then squeeze the roots of Wyrmfang Blade causing 1d6+6 of acid damage. You will then return to the location of your Illusion, in it's grandiose pose, and you make a witty quip. (+1 levels of exhaustion to wielder)<br><br>  <br><br>Each time a successful Firm Handshake Bonus Action is performed, roll a d20. On a natural 1, Wyrmfang Blade breaks and is destroyed causing 1d20 acid damage to the wielder. Wyrmfang Blade regains all expended charges daily at dawn.<br><br>  <br><br>Curse. This Dagger is cursed. Attuning to this item curses you until you are targeted by a wish spell. The only way to remove exhaustion caused by Wyrmfang Blade is to drink at a tavern. No amount of rest will fulfill the need for a great ale, nor will drinking alone or at a "house party". Only the company of strangers and a beverage poured by a bartender with years of experience will make you feel better. Drinking this way removes 1 level of exhaustion per hour. In addition, the wielder is always playing with Wyrmfang Blade, flipping it in their hand, waving it about, or playing Five Finger Filet (roll a d100 when playing FFF, on a multiple of 5, take 1d4 piercing damage). You are completely infatuated with Wyrmfang Blade. This will give you -3 to Charisma when talking to strangers who don't know you, but will also give you +3 to Intimidation to strangers that don't know you. If the person you are talking to has encountered or talked with you before (at least 1 day/conversation prior to the current), they know you just freaking LOVE that knife and aren't threatening. If Wyrmfang Blade is ever destroyed, you will become Distraught, being unable to actually talk with anyone until your grieving period is over (1d4 days). If you enter battle while Distraught everything reminds you of your favorite dagger and all attack rolls are with disadvantage until your grieving period is over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
