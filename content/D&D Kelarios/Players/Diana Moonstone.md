# Backstory
My mother Neomi (human, 5 foot 4 inches, dark hair, brown eyes) fell in love with a Elven Mage and had a child together. They lived together in a modest home in Staderia where my mother sold her herbs as a small healing industry's and my father went on local missions for the town and for the Shiye tribe as a form of good will between the humans and the elves. He then went on a exploration mission when I was one and went missing with a couple of Elven mages and never returned. My mother then joined my father elves tribe the Shiye and helped them by expanding her skill in herbology and became a skilled healer. She remarried an elven warrior named Khetra Longleaf when I was 2 years old and together they had my younger brother Osian Longleaf (age 18) who helps me out with stealing from the highways around our tribe land. The Gang that I lead is called the Lunar Pack after the many wolves that protect the Shiye's land. We rob the travelers since our forest is being destroyed by the rulers of Staderia and we are in need of supplies as the elves battle the guardsmen. My character has never been told what happened to her father just that he was on a important mission and that he loved me. She wants her people to be safe and doesn't really care about the town folk of Staderia and see them as destroyers of the Shiye's sacred land and their leaders as the reason her father never came home. War between two tribes was fully going on for at least seven years and has died down (cold war) till it was ended with a peace treaty between the Shiye and Staderia when Diana was 21. Diana learned their skills as a rogue from elf (Age 10 started training) Zaren Nightfall who was the original leader of the Lunar pack before handing it down to Diana when they were killed by Sheriff in a surprise attack among the main highway by Staderia. Age 16 when this happened. Diana wants wants to bring revenge for her fallen mentor/father figure by taking everything the Sheriff ever cared about. Age 17 to Age 19 met Tariq Williams at a ball in Corelia on a mission and they dated for two years until Tariq tried to kill Osian (age 16 at the time) when they broke up over a letter from Diana to him. Became the Champion of Exsoria to save Leysa allowing her to kill Sheriff Hadeon and my ex Tariq at the age of 21. Also sealed the deity of Morthadius with the help of the other champions. In doing so she lost her true father a cleric forced to serve Mortuaries. For the last five years she has been finding ways to be legendary through causing crime and organizing her gang "The Shadows" making her the unknown Alpha. Her temptation would be going down in the Shiye legends as the greatest thief imaginable, her revenge for her people, and to find out more about their father. Her greatest strength is that she can read off people body language and see what is truly going on and they are really good at slight of hand. Her greatest weakness is that she doesn't have much patience with humans and sees them as destroyers and sheep being lead by wolves.
