Trauma List
- Leysa nightmares. Wisdom saving throw each night, DC 17. Roll a d4, the nightmare is the following:
	1. Exandria being taken
	2. Diana's death.
	3. Leysa also has nightmares of Osian turning away from her and trying to kill her after finding out who the champion of Marcaith is.
	4. Leysa could begin to see her dead family in her dreams.
- Leysa once tried to bring back a small child that drowned in the harbor but failed to bring them back and feels survivor’s guilt about it. Every time she now tries to bring someone back, she thinks back to this moment, and how she couldn’t save the child.
- Leysa starts to worry that Diana might one day be forced to kill herself and that Leysa won’t be able to stop her.
- Leysa’s cousin, Maizlyn (only living cousin) is working with Domexius since they blame Diana for mind controlling Leysa into being an ally and wants to “free” her from Diana’s control.
- Leysa is terrified of losing her friends and loved ones because of mistakes she has made.
- Leysa once witnessed a Gladiator fight at school while visiting another kingdom and is still haunted by the image of a person getting brutally killed for sports and never wants to see that again.
- Leysa suspects that during that war that Diana may have been the reason a child was killed during a hold up on the road even if it was by accident.
- Leysa’s other uncle (the husband of her late father’s sister) blames Leysa for the death of his wife and son and is working with Marcaith. He blames her because her aunt and baby cousin were killed during the Masquerade ball in Carelia 5 years ago and he thinks that she should have been able to save them, instead of ‘cowering.’ He wants Leysa to suffer for ‘what she did to her aunt and cousin.
- Leysa is haunted by a decision she made with who got to eat from the Hero’s Feast all those years ago since she believes she could have saved more people from her family's army if they had just eaten of the feast too.
- Leysa could realize that she is pregnant after returning to Staderia and must deal with that new fear and trial.
- During the war she overheard Zaren tell Diana that we must do what is best for the greater good even if it means at the expense of one person we care about.
	- During the war Leysa witnessed Diana brutally kill a young crow (14 year old) after Zanren was killed but Diana didn’t know she saw it. Leysa is slightly concerned that her friend's bloodlust will be her destruction. Especially after she saw destruction Diana did to the necromancer after her father died back in the volcano, six years ago.
