The key to the system is the monster's CR corresponds to the rarity of the item. Tier 1 monsters are uncommon, Tier 2 are rare, Tier 3 are very rare, Tier 4+ are legendary.
Between 4-10 parts needed per item.
Player characters get to harvest 1 part each per encounter.

Adventures in scavenger form. Not a downtime system. Needs to be made in a workshop.

Workshops:
- Common: adventurer's tool kit
- Uncommon: any semi-permanent or village workshop
- Rare: any permanent workshop in a large city (one per duchy)
- Very rare - one per nation
- Legendary - one per continent or world
- Artifact: one in the entire setting, and possibly unique to the item being crafted.

Use any skill check that makes sense with crafting the item, not just arcana. The main ingredients and cost aren't lost in failure.
