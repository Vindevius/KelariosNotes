1. Improved Critical Hits: The 2nd dice is max damage instead of doubling damage. (Ex: 1d8 = 8 dmg)
2. Use potions as a Bonus Action instead of an Action (unless you are giving it to a downed player).
3. Point of No Return: Making 0 hp matter.
	- Injuries: draw attention to the blow that knocks them to 0. You can get up, but you have an injury. Roll a d4 to determine it. 1 is the worst (like reduced speed or bleeding damage), and 4 is the best (like a cool scar). Set the consequences.
	- The Choice: If you stay down, it’s the same as usual. If you get up, you will die when the fight is over, or you get to your hit points negative. A blaze of glory.
	- Optional: roll a d10 every few seconds when the fight is over. Once you roll a 1, you are dead.
	- Cons: use it only in really difficult situations. If you fall into lava, you don’t just get to crawl out.
4. In order to hide casting a spell, roll a sleight of hand check against a DC of 10 + the spell’s level. It is still possible for a single creature to see it based on the creature’s passive perception.
5. Inspiration can also be used to seek inspiration from the DM for the current situation. Inspiration is also a d24 dice.
6. Additional Bonus Actions
	1. Intimidate (Wisdom DC 10+Wis Save)
	2. Feint (deceive enemy, Wisdom DC 10+Wis Mod)
7. Daggerheart Inspired System.
	- Each time a player rolls a d20, the player will roll with fear or with hope. A player rolls with fear on odd numbers and with hope on even numbers. This is based on the dice roll before any modifiers. When a player rolls with fear, the DM gains 1 fear token. The DM can only have up to 10 fear tokens at a time. When a player rolls with hope, the player gains 1 hope token. Players can have up to 5 hope tokens at a time. The DM also has hope tokens for any friendly NPCs, up to 10 hope tokens.
	- The Token System works as follows:
		- The DM's token currency deals in action tokens and fear tokens. An action token is gained when a player takes a turn. These tokens can be used to activate a creature. The DM can also spend two action tokens to create one fear token.
		- Fear tokens are used for more interesting abilities. One fear token can be spent to interrupt a player's turn to do a DM turn. Two fear tokens can be spent to use a lair action. Fear tokens can also be spent to increase the tension of a scene or add a d6 to a roll.
		- Hope tokens are similar to fear tokens for the players. Hope tokens can be spent to decrease the tension of a scene. Two hope tokens can be spent on something larger or more difficult. For example, a hope token can be spent to add a d6 to a roll or to gain one spell slot of level 3 or below. For spell slots above 4th level, an extra hope is spent for each level, up to 7th level for a total of all five hope.
	- Flow of Combat:
		- Combat starts with each side rolling 1d20 for initiative, using the highest modifier for each side. If any player or creature has advantage on initiative, then that side rolls with advantage. If the DM goes first, only 1 boss or 2 creatures can be activated before the players' turn. If it is an ambush or surprise on either side, initiative is not rolled, and combat continues from that point.
		- On the players' turn, any player or friendly NPC can go in any order, including at the same time. If a player rolls with hope, that player gains a hope token, and the players continue their turns. If a player rolls with fear, after that player's turn, it will be the DM's turn, and the DM will gain a fear token.
		- For each action that a player takes, the DM gains one action token. On the DM's turn, the DM can use as many action tokens as are available to activate one creature. The DM must always use at least one action token on their turn. The DM can spend two action tokens to create a fear token and vice versa. Lair Actions cost two fear tokens. Legendary Actions are unaffected by this system and do not require a fear token to occur after another creature's turn.
		- At the end of the combat, if the DM has any remaining action tokens, the DM can convert them into fear tokens for later use, or if there are more than eight, convert all of them into an inspiration die for an enemy. The DM can only have one inspiration die at a time.
	- Critical Rolls have special effects as follows:
		- On a critical success (Nat 20), the DM does not gain an action token. For the next turn, the DM cannot use any legendary action, lair action, or attempt any attack against the players. The players have advantage on their next action.
			- If an enemy gets a critical success, the DM gains a fear token on top of the action token and has advantage on the next action.
		- On a critical failure (Nat 1), the DM gains a fear token and one action token, and the next action against the players has advantage.
			- If an enemy gets a critical failure, the DM loses a fear token, the DM's turn ends, and the players have advantage on their next action. The DM also gains a hope token for friendly NPCs.
	- Reactions & Spell abilities.
		- Reactions, such as opportunity attacks, remain the same. Players and creatures can only have one reaction per time they are being attacked.
8. Death Saves and Scars
	- When a player fails a death save, if that roll was with fear, the player rolls on the following injuries table using 2d10s. That roll is with disadvantage if the roll was a Nat 1. If the roll was with hope, nothing happens. The player does not have to roll for another failed death save until after the player is brought back from unconsciousness.
		- 2 = Lose an Eye
			- You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) Checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls more than 30 feet away, but you gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) Checks. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you're blinded.
		- 3 = Lose an Arm or a Hand
			- You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage.
		- 4 = Lose a Foot or Leg
			- Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage.
		- 5 = Limp
			- Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp.
		- 6-8 = Internal Injury
			- Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting.
		- 9-10 = Broken Ribs
			- This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10.
		- 11-13 = Horrible Scar
			- You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the scar.
		- 14-16 = Festering Wound
			- Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals.
		- 17-20 = Minor Scar
			- The scar doesn't have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the scar.
	- If a player needs to be resurrected, if the final roll that brings them back is with fear, the player loses a hope slot. If it is with hope, the player gains a hope slot if they are missing one. The missing hope slot can also be regained by the following 9th level spells: *mass heal*, *power word: heal*, *true resurrection*, and *wish*.
9. Resurrection Rules
	- If a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a resurrection challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a contribution skill check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.
	- After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final resurrection success check with no modifier. The base DC for the final resurrection check is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soul's connection to this world). For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1.
	- Upon a successful resurrection check, the player's soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded. On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.
### Optional Rules:
1. Fixing Resting Mechanics: you can only gain your health back while resting in a safe place such as a city, not from sleeping on the side of the road.
2. Players proficient in acrobatics, when they choose to dodge and still get hit, can use their reaction to make an acrobatics check to beat the attack roll. Meets it beats.
3. Roll with Emphasis: Roll two d20s and take the number furthest away from 10, for everything or nothing rolls.
4. DMG Optional Rules
	- Climb onto a bigger creature.
		- Athletics or Acrobatics check against the target's Acrobatics check. On a success, you have climbed onto the target and have advantage on attack rolls against it. You move with the creature. You can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The creature can attempt to knock you off as an action (Its Athletics check against your Athletics or Acrobatics check).
	- Disarm
		- A weapon attack against the target's Athletic or Acrobatics check causes the target to drop the item. On a success, the target drops the item but causes no damage. The attacker has a disadvantage if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has an advantage if it is larger than the attacking creature or a disadvantage if it is smaller.
