| **14**   | Your body and all your gear take on a glassy appearance for the next minute. During this time, ranged attacks that target you bounce off and target other random creatures within 30 feet of you instead.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **16**   | For the next minute, the only languages you know are Deep Speech, Primordial, and Sylvan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **17**   | You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **18**   | Your body (none of your clothing or gear) teleports 10 feet in a random direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **20**   | You cast _Tasha’s hideous laughter_ on the nearest creature to you. If there is no other creature within range, you target yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **21**   | Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **22**   | A _deck of many things_ appears hovering in front of you expectantly, only visible and touchable by you. It disappears at the end of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **23**   | Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A _remove curse_ spell can end this effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **24**   | If you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage within the next minute, you gain resistance to that type of damage for 1 hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **25**   | An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **27**   | For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of 1 action have a casting time of 1 bonus action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **28**   | You break your attunement with 1d3 of your magic items to which you are attuned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **31**   | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **33**   | Maximize the damage of the next damaging spell you cast within the next minute, instead of rolling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **34**   | Your feet and hands disappear. You fall prone and drop everything you are carrying. You cannot stand up or hold or manipulate objects until your appendages reappear at the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If you cannot see a humanoid, you appear as a naked, bald, androgynous albino human with no facial features.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **37**   | 1d6 **flumphs** controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **38**   | An overexcited flock of colorful birds (use the stat block of a **swarm of ravens**) appears in your space and attacks you. The flock disappears 1 minute later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **39**   | You regain 2d10 hit points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **40**   | You see briefly into the future. Roll a d20. The next time a creature makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, the number rolled will be replaced by what you rolled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **41**   | You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **43**   | For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **44**   | You fall asleep and have extremely happy dreams for the next minute, or until you take damage or a creature uses its action to shake you awake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **46**   | All the coins you have on your person fall to the ground at your feet.

| **50**   | You suddenly realize that you are nothing more than a fictional character in a game played by other creatures in another plane of existence, which causes you to be stunned. This existential crisis lasts until the start of your next turn, after which you shake it off as nonsense.                                                                                                                |

| **62**   | Your pants fall down. Until you use a bonus action or action to raise them up again, your walking speed is reduced to 10 feet and you have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws. If you are not wearing pants, you instead fall prone.                                                                                                                                                 |

| **64**   | You immediately make an unarmed strike against a random creature within 5 feet of you. If there is no creature within range, you target yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **65**   | Up to three creatures you choose within 30 feet of you take 4d10 lightning damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **66**   | A pit 1d10 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter appears beneath your feet. You fall unless you use your reaction to succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to grab the edge of the pit. The bottom of the pit magically rises upward 1 minute later, leaving no trace of the pit.                                                                                                                       |
| **67**   | You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **69**   | Each creature within 30 feet of you becomes invisible for the next minute. The invisibility ends on a creature when it attacks or casts a spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **74**   | A _simulacrum_ of yourself appears within 20 feet of you. It defends itself if attacked, but it cannot speak and otherwise just looks around utterly confused.

| **75**   | You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

If you fail the saving throw, you turn into a sheep for the spell’s duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **78**   | A strong wind swirls around you in a 10-foot radius, making ranged attacks going into or out of this aura automatically miss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **82**   | You sprout tiny fairy wings from your shoulders. You are under the effect of a _slow fall_ spell until they disappear after 1d8 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
