The character or NPC is proficient in causing all types of pain, both physical and psychological to captives. Torture relies on knowing the physiology of the victim, how to use tools of the trade and some psychology.

The torturer pits his knowledge of pain infliction (Int) and psychological torment (Cha) against the victim’s physical (Con) and psychological (Cha) fortitude.

As such the torturer’s Proficiency Check is the average of their Int and Cha

As such the victim’s Resistance Check is based upon their average of Con and Cha.

Essentially the torturer must break the victim if information is required. To cause a break the torturer has to pass as many checks as 1/3rd of the victims Con/Cha average rounded up. These checks are torture proficiency Vs resistance checks. The individual whom passes their check by the most is classed as being successful at either progressing the break or resisting further breaking.

Each torture cycle takes 1 hour to complete. A rest of 2 hours should be adopted between interrogations, ignoring this timeframe may put undue stress of the victim and result in heart failure. If the rest term is breached a Con check must be made by the victim with a failure resulting in the death of the victim. Each time the rest period is ignored imposes a cumulative -1 to the victims Con for these checks.

When the torturer succeeds in breaking the victim then each further successful check will reveal some important information, the torturer never knows how the process is proceeding or how near the victim is to breaking.

The torturer gains modifiers to his check based upon several factors, these have a cumulative effect.

## Torture resistance

The character has trained extensively in blocking both physical and mental pain and as such is more resistant to torture methods than others. This may be due to a high acquired pain tolerance, a mental retreat, gut determination, specialist training or hardened body parts favoured by torturers. On a successful check the character may imply a –3 to the torturers proficiency check, making him more likely to fail the Vs check and thus not proceed with breaking the character. If in communication with other people being tortured a passed check may aid these people in resisting the torture and give the torturer a -1 to his check. This is due to advice, encouragement and dissemination of techniques for the present predicament. This can even work between people who have the torture proficiency as they can benefit from outside moral encouragement as well as their own training. The bonus is not cumulative and can only reach –1 no matter how many checks or how many torture resistant people speak to the person. Torture resistance may come into play in other areas also. If extreme pain is causing the character difficulty a successful check may alleviate the suffering perhaps for a short time.
